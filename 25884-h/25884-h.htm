<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<p>Something unusual was going on at division
headquarters. The men in the nearest
regimental camps, regular and volunteer, were
&#8220;lined up&#8221; along the sentry posts and silently,
eagerly watching and waiting. For a week
rumor had been rife that orders for a move
were coming and the brigades hailed it with
delight. For a month, shivering at night in
the dripping, drenching fogs drifting in from
the Pacific, or drilling for hours each day on
the bleak slopes of the Presidio Heights, they
had been praying for something to break the
monotony of the routine. They were envious
of the comrades who had been shipped to
Manila, emulous of those who had stormed
Santiago, and would have welcomed with
unreasoning enthusiasm any mandate that bore
promise of change of scene&mdash;or duty. The afternoon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
was raw and chilly; the wet wind blew
salt and strong from the westward sea, and the
mist rolled in, thick and fleecy, hiding from
view the familiar landmarks of the neighborhood
and forcing a display of lamplights in
the row of gaudy saloons across the street that
bounded the camp ground toward the setting
sun, though that invisible luminary was still
an hour high and afternoon drill only just over.
</p>
<p>Company after company in their campaign
hats and flannel shirts, in worn blue trousers
and brown canvas leggings, the men had come
swinging in from the broad driveways of the
beautiful park to the south and, as they passed
the tents of the commanding general, even
though they kept their heads erect and noses to
the front, their wary eyes glanced quickly at
the unusual array of saddled horses, of carriages
and Concord wagons halted along the curbstone,
and noted the number of officers grouped
about the gate. Ponchos and overcoat capes
were much in evidence on every side as
the men broke ranks, scattered to their tents to
stow away their dripping arms and belts, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
then came streaming out to stare, unrebuked,
at headquarters. It was still early in the war
days, and, among the volunteers and, indeed,
among regiments of the regulars whose ranks
were sprinkled with college men who had
rubbed shoulders but a few months earlier with
certain subalterns, the military line of demarcation
was a dead letter when &#8220;the boys&#8221; were
out of sight and hearing of their seniors, and so it
happened that when a young officer came hurrying
down the pathway that led from the tents
of the general to those of the field officers of the
Tenth California, he was hailed by more than
one group of regulars along whose lines he
passed, and, as a rule, the query took the terse,
soldierly form of &#8220;What&#8217;s up, Billy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lieutenant nodded affably to several of
his fellows of the football field, but his hand
crept out from underneath the shrouding cape,
palm down, signalling caution. &#8220;Orders&mdash;some
kind,&#8221; he answered in tones just loud
enough to be heard by those nearest him. &#8220;Seen
the old man anywhere? The general wants
him,&#8221; and, never halting for reply the youngster
hurried on.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>He was a bright, cheery, brave-eyed lad of
twenty who six months earlier was stumbling
through the sciences at the great university on
the heights beyond the glorious bay, never
dreaming of deadlier battle than that in which
his pet eleven grappled with the striped team
of a rival college. All on a sudden, to the
amaze of the elders of the great republic, the
tenets and traditions of the past were thrown to
the winds and the &#8220;Hermit Nation&#8221; leaped the
seas and flew at the strongholds of the Spanish
colonies. Volunteers sprang up by the hundred
thousand and a reluctant Congress
accorded a meagre addition to the regular
army. Many a college athlete joined the
ranks, while a limited few, gifted with relatives
who had both push and &#8220;pull,&#8221; were permitted
to pass a not very exacting examination
and join the permanent establishment as second
lieutenants forthwith. Counting those commissioned
in the regular artillery and infantry,
there must have been a dozen in the thronging
camps back of the great city, and of these
dozen, Billy Gray&mdash;&#8220;Belligerent Billy,&#8221; as a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
tutor dubbed him when the war and Billy broke
out together&mdash;the latter to the extent of a four-day&#8217;s
absence from all collegiate duty&mdash;was
easily the gem of the lot. One of the &#8220;brightest
minds&#8221; in his class, he was one of the laziest;
one of the quickest and most agile when
aroused, he was one of the torpids as a rule:
One of the kind who should have &#8220;gone in for
honors,&#8221; as the faculty said, he came nearer
going out for devilment. The only son of a
retired colonel of the army who had made California
his home, Billy had spent years in camp
and field and saddle and knew the West as he
could never hope to know Haswell. The only
natural soldier of his class when, sorely against
the will of most, they entered the student battalion,
he promptly won the highest chevrons
that could be given in the sophomore year, and,
almost as promptly, lost them for &#8220;lates&#8221; and
absences. When the &#8217;Varsity was challenged
by a neighboring institute to a competitive drill
the &#8220;scouts&#8221; of the former reported that the
crack company of the San Pedros had the snappiest
captain they ever saw, and that, with far
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
better material to choose from, and more of it,
the &#8217;Varsity wouldn&#8217;t stand a ghost of a show
in the eyes of the professional judges unless
Billy would &#8220;brace up&#8221; and &#8220;take hold.&#8221; Billy
was willing as Barkis, but the faculty said it
would put a premium on laxity to make Billy a
&#8217;Varsity captain even though the present incumbents
were ready, any of them, to resign in
his favor. &#8220;Prex&#8221; said No in no uncertain
terms; the challenge was declined, whereat the
institute crowed lustily and the thing got into
the rival papers. As a result a select company
of student volunteers was formed: its members
agreed to drill an hour daily in addition to the
prescribed work, provided Billy would &#8220;take
hold&#8221; in earnest, and this was the company
that, under his command, swept the boards six
weeks later and left San Pedro&#8217;s contingent an
amazed and disgusted crowd. Then Billy went
to metaphorical pieces again until the war
clouds overspread the land; then like his
father&#8217;s son he girded up his loins, went in for
a commission and won. And here he was a
&#8220;sub&#8221; in Uncle Sam&#8217;s stalwart infantry with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
three classmates serving under him in the
ranks and half a dozen more, either as junior
officers or enlisted men, in the camps of the
volunteers. He was a handsome boy, a healthy,
hearty boy, and, as boys go, rather a good boy&mdash;a
boy in whom his mother would have found,
had she not long since been lifted above the
cares of this world, much of comfort and more
to condone, but a boy, nevertheless, who had
given his old dragoon of a dad many an anxious
hour. Now, just as he neared the legal
dividing line between youth and years of discretion,
Billy Gray had joined the third battalion
of his regiment, full of pluck, hope and
health, full of ambition to make a name for
himself in a profession he loved as, except his
father, he certainly loved nothing else, and
utterly scoffing the idea that there might come
into his life a being for the sake of whose smile
he could almost lay down his sword, for he had
yet to meet Amy Lawrence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are the women folks up at headquarters,
Billy?&#8221; asked a youth of his own years
and rank, peering eagerly through the drifting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
mist at the dim, ghostly outlines of the general&#8217;s
camp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t get to see &#8217;em. Where&#8217;s the old
man&mdash;the colonel?&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Chief
wants him toot de sweet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wanted?&#8221; called a voice from the
biggest of the neighboring tents, and a close-cropped
head was thrust out between the front
tent flaps. &#8220;That you, Billy? Who wants the
colonel? He and the &#8216;brig&#8217; rode over to the
Presidio an hour ago&mdash;ain&#8217;t got back. Come
in; I&#8217;ve started a fire in our oil stove.&#8221; A puff
of warm air blew from the interior and confirmed
the statement. It was well along in
summer and, not a dozen miles away to the east,
men were strolling about with palm-leaf fans
and wilted collars. Here, close to the gray
shores of the mighty sea, blankets and overcoats
were in demand. Hospitably the older officer
tugged at the lacings of the military front
door, swore between his set teeth when the
knots, swollen by the wet, withstood his efforts
and then shouted:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sergeant-major; send somebody here to open
this.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>A light footstep sounded on the springy
board floor, nimble fingers worked a moment
at the cords, then the flap was thrown open and
the adjutant&#8217;s office stood partially revealed.
It was a big wall tent backed up against
another of the same size and pattern. Half a
dozen plain chairs, two rough board tables littered
with books, papers and smoking tobacco,
an oil stove and a cheap clothes rack on which
were hanging raincoats, ponchos and a cape
or two, comprised all the furniture. In a stout
frame of unplaned wood, cased in their oilskins
and tightly rolled, stood the colors of the
famous regiment; and back of them, well
within the second tent where one clerk was
just lighting a camp lantern, were perched
on rough tables a brace of field desks with
the regimental books. The sergeant-major,
a veteran of years of service in the regulars,
sat at one of them. A young soldier, he
who had unfastened the tent flap to admit
Lieutenant Gray, was just returning to his seat
at the other. Two orderlies lounged on a bench
well beyond and back of the sergeant-major&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
seat, and a bugler, with his hands in his pockets,
was smoking a short brier-root pipe at the
opposite or back doorway. Woe to the enlisted
men who sought the presence of the colonel or
adjutant through any other channel. The sergeant-major
would drop on him with the force
of a baseball bat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who all are over yahnduh at the chief&#8217;s?&#8221;
asked the adjutant, as soon as he had his visitor
well inside, and the soft accent as well as
the quaint phraseology told that in the colonel&#8217;s
confidential staff officer a Southerner spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All the brigade and most regimental commanders
&#8217;cept ours, I should say, and they seem
to be waiting for them. Can&#8217;t we send?&#8221; was
the answer, as the junior whipped off his campaign
hat and sprinkled the floor with the vigorous
shakes he gave the battered felt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have sent,&#8221; said his entertainer briefly, as
he filled a pipe from the open tobacco box and
struck a safety match. &#8220;Orderly galloped
after him ten minutes ago. Blow the brigade
and battalion commanders! What I asked you
was who are the women up there?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, you didn&#8217;t! You said, &#8216;who all are up
yonder?&#8217; I&#8217;m a sub, and s&#8217;posed you meant
<i>men</i>&mdash;soldiers&mdash;officers. What have I to do
with anybody in petticoats?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m a grizzled vet of a dozen years&#8217;
duty, crows&#8217; feet and gray hairs a-comin&#8217;,&#8221;
grinned the adjutant, pulling at a long curly
mustache and drawing himself up to his full
height of six feet, &#8220;and when you&#8217;re as old as
I am and half as wise, Billy, you&#8217;ll know that
a pretty girl is worth ten times the thought our
old frumps of generals demand. My name
ain&#8217;t Gordon if I haven&#8217;t a mind to waltz over
there through the mist and the wind just to
tell them I&#8217;ve sent for Squeers. Then I&#8217;ll get
a look at the girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go back,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;and
you&#8217;ve no business to&mdash;with Mrs. Gordon and
an interesting family to consider. What tent&#8217;d
the ladies go to? <i>I</i> didn&#8217;t see &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Gordon, suh,&#8221; said the adjutant, with
placid superiority, &#8220;considers it a reflection on
her sex when I fail to pay it due homage. Of
course you didn&#8217;t see the ladies. The party
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
was shown into the general&#8217;s own domicile.
Couldn&#8217;t you see how many young fellows were
posing in picturesque attitudes in front of it?
Awe Hank!&#8221; he suddenly shouted to an officer
striding past the tent in dripping mackintosh.
&#8220;Goin&#8217; up to division headquarters? Just tell
the staff or the chief I&#8217;ve sent an orderly galloping
after Squeers. He&#8217;s halfway to the
Presidio now, but it&#8217;ll be an hour before they
can get back.&#8221; The silent officer nodded and
went on, whereat Gordon made a spring for the
entrance and hailed again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Hank! Who are the damsels?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The answer came back through the fog:
</p>
<p>&#8220;People from the East&mdash;looking for a runaway.
Old gent, pretty daughter, and pretty
daughter&#8217;s prettier cousin. Heard the orders?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn the orders! They don&#8217;t touch <i>us</i>.
Where do they come from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;rect from Washington, they say. Three
regiments to sail at once, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know all that!&#8221; shouted Gordon
impatiently. &#8220;It was all over camp an hour
ago! Where do they&mdash;the girls&mdash;come from?
What&#8217;s their name?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t presented,&#8221; was the sulky reply.
&#8220;Let a lot of stuffy old women show up in
search of long-lost sons and those fellows at
headquarters unload them on us in less than no
time, but a brace of pretty girls&mdash;! Why, they
double the gate guards so that no outsider can
so much as see them. Billy, here, knows &#8217;em.
Ask him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time the youngster had ranged up
alongside the adjutant and was laughingly
enjoying the latest arrival&#8217;s tirade at the
expense of the headquarters&#8217; staff, but at his
closing words Lieutenant Billy&#8217;s grin of amusement
suddenly left his face, giving way to a
look of blank amaze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> know &#8217;em! I haven&#8217;t been east of the Big
Muddy since I was a kid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They asked for you all the same, just after
you started. &#8217;Least one of &#8217;em did&mdash;for What&#8217;s-his-name?&mdash;the
chief&#8217;s military legal adviser,
came out bareheaded and called after you, but
you were out of hearing. He said the cousin,
the prettiest one, recognized you as you skipped
away from the general&#8217;s tent and pointed you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
out to her friend. Somebody explained you
were running an errand for one of those aides
too lazy to go himself, and that you&#8217;d be back
presently.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go at once, young man,&#8221; said the
adjutant, laying a mighty hand on the junior&#8217;s
square shoulder. &#8220;Stand not upon the order
of your going, but git! Never you mind about
the colonel. He won&#8217;t be <i>here</i> until after he&#8217;s
been <i>there</i>, and he&#8217;s in for a rasping over this
morning&#8217;s inspection. Just look at the report.
Sergeant-major, send me Colonel Colt&#8217;s
report!&#8221; he called aloud, tossing his head back
as he spoke, &#8220;Come in, Parson; come out of
the wet.&#8221; And, eager enough to read a famous
inspector&#8217;s criticisms of the appearance of the
regiment, the officer addressed as Parson
shoved briskly into the tent.
</p>
<p>The young soldier who had opened the tent
flap a few minutes before came forward with
a folded paper which, in silence, he handed the
adjutant and turned back to his desk. Mr.
Gordon took the paper, but his eyes followed
the soldier. Then he called, somewhat sharply:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Morton!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young fellow stopped at the dividing
crack between the two tent floors, and slowly
faced the three officers. He was slender, well
built, erect. His uniform fitted him trimly,
and was worn with easy grace, his hands and
feet were small and slender, his eyes and hair
dark and fine, his features delicate and clear
cut, his complexion a trifle blistered and beaten
by the harsh winds that whistled in every day
from the sea, and, as he turned, all three officers
were struck by its extreme pallor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sick again, Morton,&#8221; said the adjutant
somewhat sternly. &#8220;I thought I told you
to see Dr. Heffernan. Have you done so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;wasn&#8217;t sick enough,&#8221; faltered the young
soldier. &#8220;I was all right a minute or two&mdash;or
rather this morning, sir. It&#8217;ll be over presently.
Perhaps it was the smell of the oil that
did it&mdash;the stove is close to my desk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Gordon continued to look at him doubtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Move your desk across the tent for the present,
anyhow,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll speak to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
doctor myself. With all this newspaper hullabaloo
about our neglect of the sick,&#8221; continued
he, turning to his friends, &#8220;if a man changes
color at sight of a smash-up he must be turned
over to the Red Cross at once. What is it,
orderly?&#8221; he finished suddenly, as the tent flaps
parted and a soldier in complete uniform, girt
with his belt of glistening cartridges, stood at
salute, some visiting cards in his gloved hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Gray here, sir?&#8221; was the comprehensive
answer. Then, catching sight of
the young officer who stepped quickly forward,
he held forth the cards.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The adjutant-general&#8217;s compliments, sir,
and he&#8217;d be glad if the lieutenant would come
over at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gray took the cards, curiously studied them
and then read aloud, one after the other, and
placing the topmost underneath the other two
as soon as read.

<p>It was the last name that lay uppermost at
the end, receiving particular attention, and the
Parson noted it.

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the pretty cousin, Billy,&#8221; quoth he.
&#8220;Case of the last shall be first, don&#8217;t you see?
Scoot now, you lucky boy, and tell us all about
it later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Gray was still gazing dreamily at the
cards.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I never met any of them before in
my life,&#8221; said he. &#8220;There must be some mistake.
Yet&mdash;that name&mdash;sounds familiar&mdash;somehow,&#8221;
and &#8220;that&#8221; was the only name now in
sight. &#8220;I&#8217;m off,&#8221; he suddenly announced, and
vanished.
</p>
<p>There was a sound of light, quick footsteps
on the flooring of the rearward tent at the
same time. The sergeant-major glanced up
from his writing; looked at a vacant desk,
then at the clock, then, inquiringly, at his regimental
deity&mdash;the adjutant. It was just the
hour of the day at which all manner of papers
were coming down from division and brigade
headquarters to be duly stamped, noted and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
stacked up for the colonel&#8217;s action. This
was the young clerk Morton&#8217;s especial function,
but Morton had left the office and was
gone.

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p>The little party of visitors in the general&#8217;s
personal tent made a striking contrast to that
assembled under the official canvas. In the
latter, seated on camp stools and candle boxes
or braced against the tent poles were nearly a
dozen officers, all in the sombre dark blue regulation
uniform, several in riding boots and
spurs, some even wearing the heavy, frogged
overcoat; all but two, juniors of the staff, men
who stood on the shady side of forty, four of the
number wearing on their shoulders the silver
stars of generals of division or brigade, and
among their thinning crops of hair the silver
strands that told of years of service. One man
alone, the commanding general, was speaking;
all the others listened in respectful silence. In
the gloom of that late, fog-shrouded afternoon
a lantern or two would have been welcome, but
the conference had begun while it was still
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
light enough for the chief to read the memoranda
on his desk, and now he was talking without
notes. In the array of grave, thoughtful
faces, some actually somber and severe in
expression, a smile would have seemed out of
place, yet, all of a sudden, grim features
relaxed, deep-set eyes twinkled and glanced
quickly about in search of kindred sympathetic
spirits, and more than half the bearded faces
broadened into a grin of merriment and as
many heads were suddenly uplifted, for just as
the gray-haired chief ended an impressive
period with the words: &#8220;It will be no laughing
matter if I can lay hold of them,&#8221; there burst
upon the surprised ears of the group a peal of
the merriest laughter imaginable&mdash;the rippling,
joyous, musical laughter of happy girlhood
mingling with the hearty, wholesome, if somewhat
boyish, outburst of jollity, of healthful
youth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Merciful powers!&#8221; exclaimed the chief. &#8220;I
had forgotten all about those people. They
must have been here twenty minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sixty-five, sir, by the watch,&#8221; said a saturnine-looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
soldier, tall and stalwart, and
wearing the shield of the adjutant-general&#8217;s
department on the collar of his sack coat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They ought to go, then,&#8221; was the placid
suggestion of a third officer, a man with keen
eyes, thin, almost ascetic, face, but there
twitched a quaint humor about the lines of his
lips. &#8220;That visit&#8217;s past the retiring age.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then another peal of merriment from the
adjoining tent put stop to conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t lack for entertainers,&#8221; hazarded
a staff officer as soon as he could make himself
heard. &#8220;The solemn-looking Gothamite who
came with them must have slipped out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems he knows Colonel Armstrong,&#8221; said
the chief thoughtfully. &#8220;I sent for him an
hour ago, and he may be piloting Mr. Prime
around camp, looking up the runaway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Another case?&#8221; asked a brigade commander
with a shrug of his shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Another case,&#8221; answered the general, with
a sigh. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t always home troubles that
drive them to it. This boy had everything a
doting father could give him. What on earth
could make <i>him</i> bolt and enlist for the war?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>No one answered for a moment. Then the
officer with the humorous twinkle about the
eyes and the twitch at the lip corners, bent forward,
placed his elbows on his knees, his fingers
tip to tip, gazed dreamily at the floor, and sententiously
said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whereupon his next neighbor, a stocky,
thickset man in the uniform of a brigadier,
never moving eye, head or hand, managed to
bring a sizable foot in heavy riding boot almost
savagely upon the slim gaiter of the humorist,
who suddenly started and flushed to the temples,
glanced quickly at the chief, and then as
quickly back to the floor, his blue eyes clouded
in genuine distress.
</p>
<p>The general&#8217;s gray face had seemed to grow
grayer in the gloom. Again there came, like
a rippling echo, the chorus of merry laughter
from the adjoining tent, only it seemed a trifle
subdued, possibly as though one or two of the
merry-makers had joined less heartily. With
sudden movement the general rose: &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve
kept you long enough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let the three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
regiments be got in readiness at once, but relax
no effort in&mdash;that other matter. Find the guilty
parties if a possible thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then the group dissolved. One or two
of the number looked back, half-hesitating, at
the entrance of the tent, but the chief had turned
again to the littered table before him, and seating
himself, rested his gray head in the hand
nearest his visitors. It was as though he wished
to conceal his face. One of the last to go&mdash;the
thin-faced soldier with the twinkling blue eyes,
hung irresolutely behind the chief a moment as
though he had it in his mind to speak, then
turned and fairly tiptoed out, leaving the camp
commander to the society of a single staff officer,
and to the gathering darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kindly say to Mr. Prime, or his friends,
that I will join them in a moment,&#8221; said the
former, presently, without so much as uplifting
head or eye, and the aide-de-camp left as noiselessly
as his predecessor, the humorist. But
when he was gone and &#8220;The Chief&#8221; sat alone,
the sound of merry chat and laughter still
drifted in with the mist at the half-opened
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
entrance. Shadowy forms flitted to and fro
between the official tent and the lights beginning
to twinkle at brigade headquarters across
the wide roadway. An orderly scratched at the
tent flap, but got no answer. The lone occupant
sat well back in the gloomy interior and
could barely be distinguished. The waiting
soldier hesitated a moment, then entered and
stamped once upon the wooden floor, then turned
and noiselessly stepped out, for, anticipating
his question, the general spoke:
</p>
<p>&#8220;No light just yet, orderly. I&#8217;ll call you&mdash;in
a moment. Just close the tent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At his hand, he needed no light to find it,
lay a little packet that had been passed in to
him with the mail while the council was still
in session. It was stoutly wrapped, tightly
corded, and profusely sealed, but with the sharp
point of an eraser the general slit the fastenings,
tore off the wrapper, and felt rather than
saw, that a bundle of letters, rolled in tissue
paper and tied with ribbon, ribbon long since
faded and wrinkled, lay within. This he carefully
placed in a large-sized military letter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
envelope, moistened and pressed tight the
gummed flap, stowed it in the inner pocket of
the overcoat that hung at the rear tent pole,
reduced the wrapper and its superscription to
minute fragments, and dropped them into the
waste-basket, all as carefully and methodically
as though life knew neither hurry nor worry;
then bowed his lined face in both hands a
moment in utter silence and in unmistakable
sadness. Presently his lips moved: &#8220;Can you
look down and see that I have kept my word,
Agnes?&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;God help me to find
him and save him&mdash;yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Once again the laughter, the gay young
voices, rang from the other tent. All over
camp, far and near, from the limits of the park
to the very slope of the height at the north, the
evening bugles were calling by thousands the
thronging soldiery to mess or roll call. Slowly
the General rose, drew on his overcoat, and in
another moment, under the sloping visor of his
forage-cap, with eyes that twinkled behind
their glasses, with a genial smile softening every
feature, his fine soldierly face peered in on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
scene of light, of merriment and laughter under
the canvas roof of the only home he knew in
the world&mdash;the soldier home of one whose life
had been spent following the flag through bivouac,
camp or garrison, through many a march,
battle and campaign all over the broad lands of
the United States until now, at the hour when
most men turned for the placid joys of the fireside,
the love of devoted and faithful wife, the
homage and affection of children, the prattle
and playful sports of children&#8217;s children&mdash;homeless,
wifeless, childless he stood at the border
of the boundless sea, soldier duty pointing
the way to far distant, unknown and undesired
regions, content to follow that flag to the end
of the world, if need be, and owning no higher
hope or ambition than to uphold it to the end
of his life.
</p>
<p>There was nothing in such a face as his to
put a check to fun and merriment, yet, all on
a sudden, the laughter died away. Three young
gallants in soldier garb sprang to their feet and
faced him with appeal and explanation in their
speaking eyes, although only one of their number
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
found his tongue in time to put the matter
into words. There were only two girls when
the general left that tent to meet his officers at
four o&#8217;clock, and now there were four, and the
four were having five-o&#8217;clock tea.
</p>
<p>At least any one would have said they were
four blithe girls, innocent of graver responsibilities
than social calls and dinner or dance
engagements, for never looked four young
women so free from the cares of this world as did
those who were picturesquely grouped about the
General&#8217;s camp table and under the brilliant
reflector of the General&#8217;s lamp, but the plain
gold circlet on the slender finger of the merriest
and noisiest and smallest of the four, and the
fact that she had nothing to say to the elder
of the three attendant officers except in the brief,
indifferent tones of assured proprietorship, and
very much to say to the others, told a different
story. The General&#8217;s manner lost none
of its kindness, even though a close observer
would have seen that his face lost a little of its
light as he recognized in the evident leader of
the revels and mistress of the situation the wife
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
of his senior aide-de-camp. An hour before he
thought her a thousand miles away&mdash;and so did
her husband.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless your dear old heart!&#8221; exclaimed the
little lady, springing to her feet, facing him
with indomitable smiles and thrusting forward
two slender, white, bejeweled hands. &#8220;No&mdash;don&#8217;t
say you disapprove! Don&#8217;t scold! Don&#8217;t
do anything but sit right down here and have
a cup of your own delicious tea&mdash;(Frank, some
boiling water)&mdash;that no one makes for you as
I do&mdash;you&#8217;ve owned it many a time. And then
we&#8217;re all going in to the Palace for dinner and
then to the theatre, and I&#8217;ll tell you all about
it between the courses or between the acts. Oh,
you poor dear! I ought to have come before&mdash;you&#8217;ve
been working yourself to death!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And by this time, resolutely pulling, she had
towed the General to a chair, and into this, his
favorite leather-armed, canvas-backed, hickory-framed
companion of many a year, she deftly
dropped him and then, giving him no chance
for a word, gayly pirouetting, she seized one
after another upon each member of the party
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
present&mdash;an accomplished little mistress of ceremonies
encased in a tailor-made traveling suit
that rendered her proof against a dozen minor
ills, so beautifully was it cut and fitted to her
pretty figure&mdash;and, with inexhaustible flow of
merry words, presented her or him to the veteran
in the chair:
</p>
<p>&#8220;This, my honored General, first and foremost,
is Miss Mildred Prime, daughter of a
thousand earls is she, yet one <i>vastly</i> to be
desired, though I say it who should not, for she
hails from New York, which is enough to make
me hate her, whereas we&#8217;ve just sworn an eternal
friendship. You&#8217;ve only casually met her
and her folks before, but <i>I</i> can tell you all
about them. You should have put Frank at
the head of your Intelligence Bureau, General.
<i>He&#8217;d</i> never find out anything, but <i>I</i> would.
We came on the same train together all the
way from Ogden.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A tall, dark-eyed, dark-haired, oval-faced
girl, coloring slightly in evident embarassment
over these odd army ways, courtesied smilingly
to the General and seemed to be pleading
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
dumbly for clemency if there had been transgression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; hurried on the voluble little woman,
seizing another feminine wrist, &#8220;is Miss Cherry
Langton&mdash;Cherry Ripe we call her at home this
summer, the dearest girl that ever lived except
myself, and one you&#8217;ll simply delight in&mdash;as you
do in me&mdash;when you get to know her. She is,
as you have often been told and have probably
forgotten, the only good-looking member of
Frank&#8217;s family&mdash;his first cousin. She was
moping her heart out after all the nice young
men in Denver went to the wars, and withering
on the stem until I told her she should go too,
when she blossomed and blushed with joy as
you see her now, sir. Cherry, make your manners.&#8221;
Cherry, whose name well described
her, was only waiting for a chance, laughing
the while at the merry flow of her chaperon&#8217;s
words, and, at the first break, stepped quickly
forward and placed her hand frankly in the
outstretched palm of her host, then glanced
eagerly over her shoulder as though she would
say: &#8220;But you must see <i>her</i>,&#8221; and her bright
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
eyes sought and found the fourth feminine
member of the group.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And this,&#8221; said Mrs. Frank Garrison,
bravely, yet with a trifle less confidence of
manner, with indeed a faint symptom of hesitancy,
&#8220;is Miss Amy Lawrence,&#8221; and in
extending her little hand to take that of the
most retiring of the three girls, only the finger
tips and thumb seemed to touch. Miss Lawrence
came quickly forward, and waiting for
no description, bowed with quiet grace and dignity
to the chief and, smiling a bit gravely,
said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle left word that he would soon return,
General, but he has been gone with Colonel
Armstrong nearly an hour. I hope we have
not taken too great a liberty,&#8221; and her glance
turned to the substantial tea service on the rude
camp table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>I&#8217;m</i> responsible for that&mdash;and for any
and every iniquity here committed, solely
because I know our General too well to believe
he would allow famishing damsels to faint for
lack of sustenance.&#8221; It was Mrs. Garrison, of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
course, who spoke. &#8220;I simply set Frank and
his fellows to work, with the result that tea
and biscuit, light and warmth, mirth and merriment,
faith, hope and charity sprang up like
magic in this gloomy old tent, and here we are
still. Now, say you&#8217;re glad I came, General,
for these stupid boys&mdash;Oh! I quite forgot! Let
me present the slaves of the lamp&mdash;the spirit
lamp, General. Frank you know&mdash;too well, I
dare say. Stand forth, vassal Number Two.
This, General, is Captain Schuyler, a mite of a
man physically&mdash;a Gothamite, in fact&mdash;but a
tower of wit and wisdom when permitted to
speak.&#8221; (A diminutive youngster, with a head
twice too big for his body, and a world of fun
in his sparkling eyes, bowed elaborately to his
commanding general, but prudently held his
peace.) &#8220;Captain Schuyler, my dear General,
meekly bears the crescent of the subsistence
department on his beautifully high and unquestionably
New York-made collars. He hasn&#8217;t
an idea on the subject of supplies except that
commissary cigars are bad, but his senator said
he had to have something and that&#8217;s what he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
got. He&#8217;d rather be second lieutenant of regular
infantry any day, but that was too high for
him. <i>Here&#8217;s</i> a youth it fits to a &#8216;t&#8217;&mdash;Mr. William
Gray of the &mdash;teenth Foot, whom I knew
years ago when we were kids in the same camp,
and whose best claim to your notice is that you
knew his father. He says so, and hopes you&#8217;ll
forgive all his budding iniquities on the
strength of it.&#8221; The General nodded with a
grin at the youngster who stood at Miss Lawrence&#8217;s
left, and then held up his hand for
silence, shutting off further presentations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll forgive anything but more chatter,&#8221;
said he, with a placid smile, &#8220;provided you
give me some tea at once. Then I should be
glad to know how you all happened to meet
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My doing entirely, General. (Frank, another
cup&mdash;quick!) Cherry came with me to surprise
my husband&mdash;an easy thing to do&mdash;I&#8217;m always
doing it. We found him here, by your orders,
striving to entertain these two charming damsels&mdash;the
last thing on earth he is capable of
doing, however valuable he may be with orders
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
and correspondence. <i>I</i> heard Mr. Prime&#8217;s story
and at once suggested Colonel Armstrong. <i>I</i>
heard Miss Lawrence exclaim at sight of Billy
here, and saw a case of old acquaintance and
sent for him forthwith. So easy to say: &#8216;The
adjutant-general&#8217;s compliments&#8217;&mdash;<i>I</i> found that,
after all, they had never met, but Miss Lawrence
had seen him at the head of some famous
student company. <i>I</i> it was who presented him
to her, and summoned Captain Schuyler to
meet once more his fellow-citizens, the Primes.
<i>I</i> it was who ordered lamps, fire and the tea
things. <i>I</i> am the good fairy who wrought the
transformation. Behold me with my wand!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She seized Miss Langton&#8217;s slender umbrella
and, waving it over her curly little head,
pirouetted again in triumphant gayety.
</p>
<p>The General was thoughtfully sipping his tea
and studying her as she chattered and danced.
When she paused a moment for breath he again
held up his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Armstrong went with Mr. Prime,
did he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With every assurance that the prodigal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
should be produced forthwith and restored to
the paternal bosom,&#8221; declaimed Mrs. Garrison
melodramatically, and would have ranted on,
never noting the flush of pain and embarrassment
that almost instantly appeared in the
faces of Miss Lawrence and her dark-eyed Eastern
cousin, nor seeing the warning in her husband&#8217;s
eyes, but at the moment the tent flap
was thrown back and held open to admit a tall,
gray-haired civilian whose silk hat was uplifted
as he entered, in courteous recognition of
the group, despite the distress that was betrayed
in the pallor of his face and the instant glance
of his dark eyes toward the slender girl, who
stepped eagerly forward. Mrs. Garrison, turning
quickly, saw, and with swift, agile movement,
sprang to one side. The General slowly
struggled up from his easy-chair. Reaching
her father&#8217;s side, Miss Prime laid her hand
upon his arm, looking fondly and anxiously
into his face.
</p>
<p>A soldierly, middle-aged officer, in dripping
forage cap and rain coat, stepped quickly in
and lowered the flap.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
&#8220;Did you find him, father?&#8221; was Miss
Prime&#8217;s low-toned, faltering question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We found&mdash;the soldier referred to; Colonel
Armstrong has been most kind; but&mdash;it wasn&#8217;t
your brother at all, my child.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p>A day had dawned on the Presidio Heights
as brilliant as its predecessor had been dismal.
A soft south wind had swept the fogs of the
Pacific far out to sea and cleared the summer
sky of every wisp of vapor. The sun of early
August shone hot and strong upon the sandy
wastes between the westward limits of the division
camps and the foamy strand beneath the
low bluffs, and beat upon the canvas homes of
the rejoicing soldiery, slacking cloth and cordage
so that the trim tent lines had become
broken and jagged, thereby setting the teeth of
&#8220;Old Squeers&#8221; on edge, as he gazed grimly
from under the brim of his unsightly felt hat
and called for his one faithful henchman, the
orderly. Even his adjutant could not condone
the regimental commander&#8217;s objectionable
traits, for a crustier old villain of a veteran
lived not in the line of the army. &#8220;Ould
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
Canker&#8221; the troopers had dubbed him during
the few years he had served in the cavalry,
transplanted from a foot regiment at the time
of the reorganization, so-called, of the army in
&#8217;71; but a few years of mounted duty in Arizona
and later in the Sioux country had sickened
him of cavalry life and he gladly accepted
a chance to transfer back to the infantry. Now,
twenty years after, risen by degrees to the
grade of lieutenant-colonel, he found himself in
command of a famous old regiment of regulars,
whose colonel had donned the stars
of a general officer of volunteers, and the pet
name&mdash;save the mark&mdash;of cavalry days had
given place to the unflattering <i>sobriquet</i>
derived from that horror of boyish readers&mdash;the
ill-favored schoolmaster of Dotheboys Hall.
He had come to the &mdash;teenth with a halo of
condemnation from the regiment in which he
had served as major and won his baleful name,
and &#8220;the boys&#8221; of his new command soon
learned to like him even less than those who
had dubbed him &#8220;Squeers,&#8221; because, as they
explained, there wasn&#8217;t any privilege or pleasure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
he would not &#8220;do the boys&#8221; out of if he possibly
could. Gordon had promptly tendered
his resignation as regimental adjutant when his
beloved colonel left the post to report for duty
in the army destined for Cuba, but Lieutenant-Colonel
Canker declined to accept it, and fairly
told Gordon that, as he hadn&#8217;t a friend among
the subalterns, there was no one else to take it.
Then, too, the colonel himself wrote a word or
two and settled the matter.
</p>
<p>A big review had been ordered for the morning.
An entire brigade of sturdy volunteers
was already forming and marching out by battalions
to their regimental parades, the men
showing in their easy stride and elastic carriage
the effects of two months&#8217; hard drill and gradually
increasing discipline. The regulars were
still out in the park, hidden by the dense foliage
and busy with their company drills. The adjutant
and clerk were at their papers in the big
office tent, and only the sentries, the sick and
the special duty men remained about the body of
camp. There was no one, said Private Noonan
to himself, as he paced the pathway in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
front of the colonel&#8217;s tent, after having scrupulously
saluted him on his appearance, &#8220;No wan
fur the ould man to whack at, barrin&#8217; it&#8217;s me,&#8221;
but even Canker could find nothing to &#8220;whack
at&#8221; in this veteran soldier who had served in
the ranks since the days of the great war and
had borne the messages of such men as Sheridan,
Thomas and McPherson when Canker
himself was sweating under his knapsack and
musket. Like most men, even most objectionable
men, Canker had some redeeming features,
and that was one of them&mdash;he had been a private
soldier, and a brave one, too, and was
proud of it.
</p>
<p>But life had little sunshine in it for one of
his warped, ill-conditioned nature. There was
a profound conviction in the minds of the company
officers that the mere sight of happiness
or content in the face of a subordinate was
more than enough to set Canker&#8217;s wits to work
to wipe it out. There was no doubt whatever
in the minds of the subalterns that the main
reason why Squeers was so manifestly &#8220;down
on&#8221; Billy Gray was the almost indestructible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
expression of good nature, jollity and enthusiasm
that had shown in the little fellow&#8217;s face
ever since he joined the regiment. &#8220;If we call
the old man Squeers we should dub Billy Mark
Tapley,&#8221; said Gordon one day, when the lad
had laughed off the effect of an unusually acrimonious
rasping over a trivial error in the
Guard Report book. &#8220;He&#8217;s no end kind when
a fellow&#8217;s in a fix,&#8221; said Gray, in explanation,
&#8220;and all the time he was soaking me I was
thinking how he stood by Jimmy Carson in <i>his</i>
scrape&#8221;&mdash;a serious scrape it was, too, for young
Carson, detailed to escort certain prisoners to
Alcatraz and intrusted with certain funds to be
turned over to the chief quartermaster of the
department, had unaccountably fallen into a
deep sleep aboard the train and awoke to find
both funds and prisoners gone. Explanations
were useless. The commanding general would
listen to no excuse; a court-martial was ordered,
and a very worthy young officer&#8217;s military
career seemed about to close under a cloud,
when &#8220;Old Canker&#8221; threw himself into the
breach. He had long suspected the sergeant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
who had accompanied the party in immediate
command of the little guard. He hated the
commanding general with all his soul, and,
how it came about no one could thoroughly
explain, but one day Canker turned up with
indubitable proof that the sergeant was the
thief&mdash;that he was bribed to bring about the
escape of the prisoners, and that he had drugged
the fresh spring water he brought in to the
young officer after the burning heat of the
desert was left behind in the dead of the summer
night. Canker even recovered most of the
stolen money, for there was a woman in the
case, and she had safely stowed it away. Carson
was cleared and Canker triumphant. &#8220;See
what the man can do when his sense of justice
is aroused,&#8221; said the optimists of the army.
&#8220;Justice be blowed,&#8221; answered the cynics.
&#8220;He never would have raised his finger to help
Carson but for the joy of proving the General
unjust, and a regimental pet&mdash;the sergeant&mdash;a
thief.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Yet Gray reverted to this episode as explanation
of his tolerance of Canker&#8217;s harshness and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
thereby gave rise to a rejoinder from the lips
of a veteran company commander that many a
fellow was destined to recall before the regiment
was two months older:
</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to settle it, somebody&#8217;s got to find
his life or his commission in jeopardy. Maybe
it&#8217;ll be you, Billy, and I&#8217;m betting <i>you</i> won&#8217;t
find Squeers a guardian angel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Yet on this sunshiny summer morning, with
hope and sunshine and confidence in his handsome,
boyish face, Lieutenant Gray came bounding
up to the presence of the regimental commander
as though that sour-visaged soldier
were an indulgent uncle who could not say him
nay. A stylish open carriage in which were
seated two remarkably pretty girls and a gray-haired,
slender gentleman, had reined up in the
street opposite the entrance to the row of officers&#8217;
tents and Canker had ripped out his
watch, with an ugly frown on his forehead, for
three of his companies had just marched in
from drill, and three of their young lieutenants,
on the instant of dismissal, had made straight
for the vehicle and he half-hoped to find they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
had lopped off a minute or so of the allotted
hour. The sound of merry laughter seemed to
grate on his ears. The sight of Gray&#8217;s beaming
face seemed to deepen the gloom in his own.
Instinctively he knew the youngster had come
to ask a favor and he stood ready to refuse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel, I&#8217;d like mightily to go over and
see that review this morning, sir; and Mr.
Prime is good enough to offer me a seat in his
carriage. May I go, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t go anywhere, sir, with the tents
of your company in that disgraceful condition.
Just look at them, sir,&mdash;as ragged as a wash
line on a windy day!&#8221; And Canker scowled
angrily at the young fellow standing squarely
at attention before him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that, colonel, but the sun did that
while we were out at drill, and the men will
straighten everything in ten minutes. I&#8217;ll give
the order now, sir.&#8221; And Billy looked as
though refusal were out of the question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll stay and see it done, sir, and <i>when</i>
it&#8217;s done&mdash;to my satisfaction&mdash;will be time
enough to ask for favors. Mr. Gordon, send
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
word to the company commanders I wish to see
them here at once,&#8221; continued the senior officer,
whirling on his heel and terminating the interview
by so doing. It was in Gray&#8217;s mind for a
brief minute to follow and plead. He had made
it tell many a time with an obstinate university
Don, but he knew the carriage was waiting&mdash;the
carriage load watching, and deep down in
his heart there was keen disappointment. He
would have given a big slice of his monthly
pay to go with that particular party, occupy
the seat opposite Amy Lawrence and gaze his
fill at her fair face. He well-nigh hated
Squeers as he hurried away to hail his first sergeant
and give the necessary orders before daring
to return to the carriage and report his failure.
His bright blue eyes were clouded and his
face flushed with vexation, for he saw that the
rearmost regiment was even now filing into the
Presidio Reservation afar off to the north, and
that no time was to be lost if his friends were
to see the review. The distant measured boom
of guns told that the General in whose honor
the ceremony was ordered was already approaching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
the appointed spot, and away over the rolling
uplands toward the Golden Gate a cavalry
escort rode into view. Billy ground his teeth.
&#8220;Run and tell them I cannot get leave,&#8221; he
called to a fellow sub. &#8220;Squeers has set me to
work straightening up camp. Turn out the
company, sergeant! Brace the tent cords and
align tents,&#8221; and a mournful wave of his forage
cap was the only greeting he dare trust
himself to give, as after a few minutes of fruitless
waiting the vacant seat was given to
another officer and the carriage rolled rapidly
away. A second or two it was hidden from his
sight behind the large wall tents along the line
of fence, then shot into full view again as he
stood at the end of the company street looking
eagerly for its reappearance. And then occurred
a little thing that was destined to live in his
memory for many a day, and that thrilled him
with a new and strange delight. He had never
been of the so-called &#8220;spooney&#8221; set at the &#8217;Varsity.
Pretty girls galore there were about that
famous institute, and he had danced at many a
student party and romped through many a reel,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
but the nearest he had ever come to something
more than a mere jolly friendship for a girl was
the regard in which he held his partner in the
&#8220;Mixed Doubles,&#8221; but that was all on account
of her exuberant health, spirits, general comeliness
of face and form, and exquisite skill in
tennis. But this day a new and eager longing
was eating at his heart; a strange, dull pang
seemed to seize upon it as he noted in a flash
that the seat that was to have been his was
occupied by an officer many years his senior, a
man he knew only by sight and an enviable
reputation, a man whose soldierly, clear-cut
face never turned an instant, for his eyes were
fixed upon a lovely picture on the opposite seat&mdash;Amy
Lawrence bending eagerly forward and
gazing with her beautiful eyes alight with sympathy,
interest and frank liking in search of
the sorely disappointed young officer. &#8220;There
he is!&#8221; she cried, though too far away for him
to hear, and then, with no more thought of
coquetry than a kitten, with no more motive
in the world than that of conveying to him an
idea of her sorrow, her sympathy, her perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
pardonable and exaggerated indignation at
what she deemed an act of tyranny on part of
his commander, with only an instant in which
to express it all&mdash;her sweet face flushed, her
eyes flamed with the light of her girlish enthusiasm
and in that instant she had kissed her
hand to him. Colonel Armstrong, turning
suddenly and sharply to see who could be the
object of interest so absorbing, caught one flitting
glimpse of Billy Gray lifting his cap in
quick acknowledgment, and the words that
were on the tip of Armstrong&#8217;s tongue the
moment before were withheld for a more auspicious
occasion&mdash;and it did not come too soon.
</p>
<p>It was only four days after that initial meeting
in the General&#8217;s tent the foggy evening of
the girl&#8217;s first visit to camp, but both in town
and on the tented field there had been several
young ladies. Junior officers had monopolized
the time and attention of the latter, but
Armstrong was a close observer and a man
who loved all that was strong, high-minded
and true in his own sex, and that was pure and
sweet and winsome in woman. A keen soldier,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
he had spent many years in active service, most
of them in the hardy, eventful and vigorous
life of the Indian frontier. He had been conspicuous
in more than one stirring campaign
against the red warriors of the plains, had won
his medal of honor before his first promotion,
and his captaincy by brevet for daring conduct
in action long antedated the right to wear the
double bars of that grade. He had seen much
of the world, at home and abroad; had traveled
much, read much, thought much, but these were
things of less concern to many a woman in our
much married army than the question as to
whether he had ever loved much. Certain it
was he had never married, but <i>that</i> didn&#8217;t
settle it. Many a man loves, said they, without
getting married, forgetful of the other side of
the preposition advanced by horrid regimental
cynics, that many men marry without getting
loved. Armstrong would not have proved an
easy man to question on that, or indeed on any
other subject which he considered personal to
himself. Even in his own regiment in the
regular service he had long been looked upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
as an exclusive sort of fellow&mdash;a man who had
no intimates and not many companions, yet,
officers and soldiers, he held the respect and
esteem of the entire command, even of those
whom he kept at a distance, and few are the
regiments in which there are not one or two
characters who are best seen and studied
through a binocular. Without being sympathetic, said
his critics, Armstrong was &#8220;square,&#8221;
but his critics had scant means of knowing
whether he was sympathetic or not. He was
a steadfast fellow, an unswerving, uncompromising
sort of man, a man who would never
have done for a diplomat, and could never have
been elected to office. But he was truthful,
just, and as the English officer reluctantly said
of Lucan, whom he hated, &#8220;Yes&mdash;damn him&mdash;he&#8217;s
brave.&#8221; The men whom he did not seem
to like in the army and who disliked him
accordingly, were compelled to admit, to themselves
at least, that their reasons were comprised
in the above-recorded, regretable, but
unmistakable fact&mdash;he didn&#8217;t like them.
Another trait, unpopular, was that he knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
when and how to say no. He smoked too much,
perhaps, and talked too little for those who
would use his words as witnesses against him.
He never gambled, he rarely drank, he never
lent nor borrowed. He was a bachelor, yet
would never join a &#8220;mess&#8221; but kept house himself
and usually had some favored comrade living
with him. He was forty and did not look
thirty-five. He was tall, erect, athletic, hardy
and graceful in build, and his face was one of
the best to be seen in many a line of officers at
parade. His eyes were steel-gray and clear and
penetrating, his features clear-cut, almost
<i>too</i> delicately cut, thought some of the best
friends he had among the men. His hair
was brown, sprinkled liberally with silver;
his mouth, an admirable mouth in every
way, was shaded and half-hidden by a long,
drooping mustache to which, some men thought
and some women said, his tapering white fingers
paid too much attention, but I doubt if a
knowledge of this criticism would have led to
the faintest alteration in the habit. Generally
the expression of Armstrong&#8217;s face was grave,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
and, on duty, a trifle stern; and not ten people
in the world were aware what humor could
twinkle in the clear, keen eyes, or twitch about
the corners of that mobile mouth. There were
not five who knew the tenderness that lay in hiding
there, for Armstrong had few living kindred
and they were men. There lived not, as he
drove this glorious August morning to the
breezy uplands beyond the camps, one woman
who could say she had seen those eyes of Armstrong&#8217;s
melt and glow with love. As for Amy
Lawrence, she was not dreaming of such a
thing. She was not even looking at him. Her
thoughts at the moment were drifting back to
that usually light-hearted boy who stood gazing
so disconsolately after them as they drove away,
her eyes were intent upon an approaching group
that presently reclaimed her wandering
thoughts.
</p>
<p>Coming up Point Lobos Avenue strode a
party of four&mdash;all soldiers. One of these, wild-eyed,
bareheaded, dishevelled, his clothing torn,
his wrists lashed behind him, walked between
two armed guards. The fourth, a sergeant,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
followed at their heels. Miss Lawrence had
just time to note that the downcast face was
dark and oval and refined, when it was suddenly
uplifted at sound of the whirring carriage
wheels. A light of recognition, almost
of terror, flashed across it, and with one bound
the prisoner sprang from between his guards,
dove almost under the noses of the startled
team, and darted through the wide-open doorway
of a corner saloon. He was out of sight
in a second.

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p>The review that morning had drawn a
crowd to the drill grounds that baffled the
efforts of the guards. Carriages from camps
and carriages from town, carts from the suburbs,
equestrians from the parks and pedestrians
from everywhere had gradually encroached
within kicking distance of the heels
of the cavalry escorting the general commanding
the department, and that official noted with
unerring eye that the populace was coming up
on his flanks, so to speak, at the moment when
the etiquette of the service required that he
should be gazing only to his immediate front
and responding to the salutes of the marching
column. Back of him, ranged in long, single
rank, was drawn up what the newspapers unanimously
described as a &#8220;brilliant&#8221; staff, despite
the fact that all were in sombre campaign uniform
and several had never been so rated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
before. In their rear, in turn, was the line of
mounted orderlies and farther still the silent
rank of the escorting troop. Sentries had been
posted to keep the throng at proper distance,
but double their force could have accomplished
nothing&mdash;the omniscient corporal could not
help them, and after asking one or two stray
officers what they would do about it, the sentries
gave way and the crowd swarmed in. It
was just as the head of the long tramping column
came opposite the reviewing point, and the
brigade commander and his staff, turning out
after saluting, found their allotted station on
the right of the reviewing party completely
taken up by the mass of eager spectators. A
minute or so was required before the trouble
could be remedied, for, just as the officers and
orderlies were endeavoring to induce the populace
to give way&mdash;a thing the American always
resists with a gay good humor that is peculiarly
his own&mdash;a nervous hack driver on the outskirts
backed his bulky trap with unexpected
force, and penned between it and the wheels of
a newly-arrived and much more presentable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
equipage a fair equestrian who shrieked with
fright and clung to her pommel as her excited
&#8220;mount&#8221; lashed out with his heels and made
splinters of the hack&#8217;s rearmost spokes and
felloes. Down went the hack on its axle point.
Out sprang a tall officer from the open carriage,
and in a second, it seemed, transferred the panic-stricken
horsewoman from the seismatic saddle
to the safety of his own seat and the ministrations
of the two young women and the gray
haired civilian who were the latest arrivals.
This done, and after one quick glance at the
lady&#8217;s helpless escort, a young officer from the
Presidio, he shouldered his way through the
crowd and stood, presently, on its inner edge,
an unperturbed and most interested spectator.
Battalion after battalion, in heavy marching
order, in the dark-blue service dress, with campaign
hats and leggings, with ranks well closed
and long, well-aligned fronts, with accurate
trace of the guides and well-judged distance, the
great regiments came striding down the gentle
slope, conscious, every officer and man, of the
admiration they commanded. Armstrong, himself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
commander of a fine regiment of volunteers
in another brigade, looked upon them
with a soldier&#8217;s eye, and looked approvingly.
Then, as the rearmost company passed the
reviewing point and gentlemen with two stars
on each shoulder extended their congratulations
to the reviewed commander with one, Armstrong
also made his way among the mounted
officers in his calm, deliberate fashion, heedless
of threatening heels and crowding forehands,
until he, too, could say his word of cordial
greeting. He had to wait a few minutes, for
the general officers were grouped and talking
earnestly. He heard a few words and knew
well enough what was meant&mdash;that quantities
of stores intended for the soldiers&mdash;even dainties
contributed by the Red Cross Society&mdash;had been
stolen from time to time and spirited off in the
dead of night, and doubtless sold in town for
the benefit of a pack of unknown scoundrels
enlisted for no better purpose. In his own regiment
his system had been so strict that no loss
was discoverable, but in certain others the deficit
was great. Complaints were loud, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
camp commander, stung possibly by comments
from the city, had urged his officers to unusual
effort, and had promised punishment to the
extent of the law on the guilty parties whenever
or wherever found.
</p>
<p>Even as he was exchanging a word with the
brigadier, Armstrong heard the exclamation:
&#8220;By Jove&mdash;they&#8217;ve caught another!&#8221; for with
a grim smile of gratification the camp commander
had read and turned over to his adjutant-general
a brief dispatch just handed him
by a mounted orderly who had galloped part.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of <i>your</i> irreproachables, Armstrong,&#8221;
said one of the staff, with something half-sneer,
half-taunt as he too read and then passed the
paper to the judge-advocate of the division.
</p>
<p>Armstrong turned with his usual deliberation.
There was ever about him a quiet dignity
of manner that was the delight of his friends
and despair of his foes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is his name?&#8221; he calmly asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of those society swells of whom you
have so many,&#8221; was the reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That does not give his name&mdash;nor identify
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
him as one of my men,&#8221; said Armstrong
coolly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I didn&#8217;t say he belonged to your
command,&#8221; was the staff officer&#8217;s response,
&#8220;but one of the kid-glove crowd that&#8217;s got into
the ranks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean the recruits in the &mdash;teenth
Infantry, I should be slow to suspect them
of any crime,&#8221; said Armstrong, with something
almost like a drawl, so slow and deliberate
was his manner, and now the steel-gray
eyes and the fair, clear-cut face were
turned straight upon the snapping eyes and
dark features of the other. There was no
love lost <i>there</i>. One could tell without so much
as seeing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re off, then! That commissary-sergeant
caught one of &#8217;em in the act&mdash;he got
wind of it and skipped, and to-day came back
in handcuffs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All of which may be as you say,&#8221; answered
Armstrong, &#8220;and still not warrant your reference
to him as one of my irreproachables.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time much of the crowd and most of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
the vehicles had driven away. The generals
still sat in saddle chatting earnestly together,
while their staff officers listened in some impatience
to the conversation just recorded. Everybody
knew the fault was not Armstrong&#8217;s, but
it was jarring to have to sit and hearken to the
controversy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ever twit or try funny
business with Armstrong,&#8221; once said a regimental
sage. &#8220;He has no sense of humor&mdash;of
that kind.&#8221; Those who best knew him knew
that Armstrong never tolerated unjust accusations,
great or small. In his desire to say an
irritating thing to a man he both envied and
respected, the staff officer had not confined himself
to facts, and it proved a boomerang.
</p>
<p>And now, Armstrong&#8217;s eyes had lighted
for an instant on the alleged culprit. Seated
opposite Miss Lawrence as the carriage
whirled across Point Lobos Avenue, and
watching her unobtrusively, he saw the
sudden light of alarm and excitement in
her expressive face, heard the faint exclamation
as her gloved hand grasped the rail of
the seat, felt the quick sway of the vehicle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
as the horses shied in fright at some object
beyond his vision. Then as they dashed on
he had seen the running guard and, just
vanishing within the portals of the corner
building, the slim figure of the escaping prisoner.
He saw the quivering hands tearing at
their fastenings. He turned to the driver
and bade him stop a minute, but it took fifty
yards of effort before the spirited horses could
be calmed and brought to a halt at the curb.
To the startled inquiries of Mr. Prime and his
daughter as to the cause of the excitement and
the running and shouting he answered simply:
&#8220;A prisoner escaped, I think,&#8221; and sent a passing
corporal to inquire the result. The man
came back in a minute.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They got him easy, sir. He had no show.
His hands were tied behind his back and he
couldn&#8217;t climb,&#8221; was the brief report.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They have not hurt him, I hope,&#8221; said
Armstrong.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. He hurt them&mdash;one of &#8217;em, at least,
before he&#8217;d surrender when they nabbed him in
town. This time he submitted all right&mdash;said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
he only ran in for a glass of beer, and was
laughing-like when I got there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. That&#8217;ll do. Go on, driver.
We haven&#8217;t a minute to lose if we are to see
the review,&#8221; he continued, as he stepped lightly
to his seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw nothing of this affair,&#8221; said Miss
Prime. &#8220;What was it all about?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor could I see,&#8221; added her father. &#8220;I
heard shouts and after we passed saw the
guard, but no fugitive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just as well&mdash;indeed I&#8217;m glad you
didn&#8217;t, uncle,&#8221; answered Miss Lawrence, turning
even as she spoke and gazing wistfully
back. &#8220;He looked so young, and seemed so
desperate, and had such a&mdash;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;<i>hunted</i>
look on his face&mdash;poor fellow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then the carriage reached the entrance
to the reservation and the subject, and the second
object of Miss Lawrence&#8217;s sympathies,
evoked that day, were for the time forgotten.
Possibly Mrs. Garrison was partly responsible
for this for, hardly had they rounded the bend
in the road that brought them in full view,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
from the left, or southern flank, of the long line
of masses in which the brigade was formed,
than there came cantering up to them, all gay
good humor, all smiles and saucy coquetry,
their hostess of the evening at the General&#8217;s
tent. She was mounted on a sorry-looking
horse, but the &#8220;habit&#8221; was a triumph of art,
and it well became her slender, rounded figure.
</p>
<p>No one who really analyzed Mrs. Frank Garrison&#8217;s
features could say that she was a pretty
woman. No one who looked merely at the general
effect when she was out for conquest could
deny it. Colonel Armstrong, placidly observant
as usual, was quick to note the glances
that shot between the cousins on the rear seat
as the little lady came blithely alongside. He
knew her, and saw that they were beginning to
be as wise as he, for the smiles with which they
greeted her were but wintry reflections of those
that beamed upon her radiant face. Prime,
paterfamilias, bent cordially forward in welcome,
but her quick eyes had recognized the
fourth occupant by this time, and there was a
little less of assurance in her manner from that
instant.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
&#8220;How <i>per</i>fectly delicious!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I
feared from what you said yesterday you
weren&#8217;t coming, and so I never ordered the carriage,
but came out in saddle&mdash;I can&#8217;t say on
<i>horse</i>back with such a wreck as this, but every
decent horse in the Presidio had to go out with
the generals and staffs, you know, and I had to
take what I could get&mdash;both horse and escort,&#8221;
she added, in confidential tone. &#8220;Oh!&mdash;May
I present Mr. Ellis? He knows you all by
name already.&#8221; The youth in attendance and
a McClellan tree two sizes too big for him,
lifted his cap and strove to smile; he had ridden
nothing harder than a park hack before that
day. &#8220;Frank says I talk of nothing else. But&mdash;where&#8217;s
Mr. Gray? Surely I thought <i>he</i> would
be with you.&#8221; This for Armstrong&#8217;s benefit in
case he were in the least interested in either
damsel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gray was detained by some duties in
camp,&#8221; explained Miss Prime, with just a trace
of reserve that was lost upon neither their new
companion nor the colonel. It settled a matter
the placid officer was revolving in his mind.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon us, Mrs. Garrison,&#8221; he said briefly.
&#8220;We must hurry. Go on, driver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>I</i> can keep up,&#8221; was the indomitable
answer, &#8220;even on this creature.&#8221; And Mrs.
Garrison proved her words by whipping her
steed into a lunging canter and, sitting him
admirably, rode gallantly alongside, and just
where Mr. Prime could not but see and admire
since Colonel Armstrong would not look at all.
He had entered into an explanation of the ceremony
by that time well under way, and Miss
Lawrence&#8217;s great soft brown eyes were fixed
upon him attentively when, perhaps, she should
have been gazing at the maneuvers. Like those
latter, possibly, her thoughts were &#8220;changing
direction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Not ten minutes later occurred the collision
between the hack and the heels that
resulted in the demolition of one and &#8220;demoralization&#8221;
of the rider of the victor. While the
latter was led away by the obedient Mr. Ellis
lest the sight of him should bring on another
nervous attack, Mrs. Garrison was suffering
herself to be comforted. Her nerves were gone,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
but she had not lost her head. Lots of Presidio
dames and damsels were up on the heights that
day in such vehicles as the post afforded. None
appeared in anything so stylish and elegant as
the carriage of the Prime party. She was a
new and comparative stranger there, and it
would vastly enhance her social <i>prestige</i>, she
argued, to be seen in such &#8220;swell&#8221; surroundings.
With a little tact and management she
might even arrange matters so that, willy nilly,
her friends would drive her home instead of
taking Colonel Armstrong back to camp. That
would be a stroke worth playing. She owed
Stanley Armstrong a bitter grudge, and had
nursed it long. She had known him ten years
and hated him nine of them. Where they met
and when it really matters not. In the army
people meet and part in a hundred places when
they never expected to meet again. She had
married Frank Garrison in a hand gallop, said
the garrison chronicles, &#8220;before she had known
him two months,&#8221; said the men, &#8220;before he
knew her at all,&#8221; said the women. She was
four years his senior, if the chaplain could be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
believed and five months his junior if <i>she</i>
could. Whatever might have been the discrepancy
in their ages at the time of the ceremony
no one would suspect the truth who saw them
now. It was he who looked aged and careworn
and harassed, and she who preserved her
youthful bloom and vivacity.
</p>
<p>And now, as she reclined as though still too
weak and shaken to leave the carriage and
return to saddle, her quick wits were planning
the scheme that should result in <i>her</i> retaining,
and his losing the coveted seat. There was little
time to lose. Most of the crowd had scattered,
and she well knew that he was only waiting
for her to leave before he would return.
Almost at the instant her opportunity came.
A covered wagon reined suddenly alongside
and kind and sympathetic voices hailed her:
&#8220;Do let us drive you home, Mrs. Garrison; you
must have been terribly shaken.&#8221; She recognized
at once the wife and daughter of a prominent
officer of the post.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how kind you are!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I was
hoping some one would come. Indeed, I <i>did</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
get a little wrench.&#8221; And then, as she moved,
with a sudden gasp of pain, she clasped Miss
Lawrence&#8217;s extended hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, you must not stir, Mrs. Garrison,&#8221;
said that young lady. &#8220;We will drive
you home at once.&#8221; Miss Prime and her father
were adding their pleas. She looked up, smiling
faintly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear I must trouble you,&#8221; she faltered.
&#8220;Oh, how stupid of me! But about Stanley
Armstrong&mdash;I haven&#8217;t even thanked him. Ah,
well&mdash;<i>he</i> knows. We&#8217;ve been&mdash;such good
friends for years&mdash;dear old fellow!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p>There had been a morning of jubilee in the
camp of the Fifth Separate Brigade, and a row
in the tents of the regulars. Up to within a
fortnight such a state of affairs would have
been considered abnormal, for the papers would
have it that the former were on the verge of
dissolution through plague, pestilence and famine
due to the neglect of officials vaguely
referred to as &#8220;the military authorities,&#8221; or
&#8220;the staff,&#8221; while, up to the coming of Canker
to command, sweet accord had reigned in the
regular brigade, and the volunteers looked on
with envy. But now a great martial magnate
had praised the stalwart citizen soldiery whom
he had passed in review early in the day, and
set them to shouting by the announcement that,
as reward for their hard work and assiduous
drill, they should have their heart&#8217;s desire and
be shipped across the seas to far Manila. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
had all been settled beforehand at headquarters.
The &#8220;chief&#8221; had known for four days
that that particular command would be selected
for the next expedition, but it tickled &#8220;the
boys&#8221; to have it put that way, and the home
papers would make so much of it. So there
was singing and triumph and rejoicing all
along the eastern verge of a rocky, roughly
paved cross street, and rank blasphemy across
the way. To the scandal and sorrow of the &mdash;teenth
Infantry some of the recent robberies
had been traced to their very doors. A commissary-sergeant
had &#8220;weakened,&#8221; a cartman
had &#8220;squealed,&#8221; and one of the most popular and
attractive young soldiers in the whole command
was now a prisoner in the guardhouse charged
with criminal knowledge of the whole affair,
and of being a large recipient of the ill-gotten
money&mdash;Morton of the adjutant&#8217;s office, a private
in Company &#8220;K.&#8221;
</p>
<p>What made it worse was the allegation that
several others, noncommissioned officers and
&#8220;special duty men,&#8221; were mixed up in the matter,
and Canker had rasped the whole commissioned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
force present for duty, in his lecture upon
the subject, and had almost intimated that officers
were conniving at the concealment of the
guilt of their sergeants rather than have it leak
out that the felony was committed in a company
of their commanding.
</p>
<p>He and Gordon had had what was described
as a &#8220;red-hot&#8221; row, all because Gordon flatly
declared that while <i>something</i> was queer about
the case of the young clerk who &#8220;had money
to burn,&#8221; as the men said, he&#8217;d bet his bottom
dollar he wasn&#8217;t a thief. Canker said such
language was a reflection on himself, as he had
personally investigated the case, was convinced
Morton&#8217;s guilt could be established, and had so
reported to the brigade commander in recommending
trial by general court-martial. Indeed
he had made out a case against the lad even
before he was arrested and returned to camp.
Gordon asked if he had seen the boy and heard
his story. Canker reddened and said he hadn&#8217;t,
and he didn&#8217;t mean to and didn&#8217;t have to. Gordon
said <i>he</i> had&mdash;he had talked with the lad
fully and freely on his being brought to camp
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
toward nine o&#8217;clock, and was greatly impressed
with his story&mdash;as would any one else be who
heard it. Canker reddened still more and said
he wouldn&#8217;t allow officers to interview prisoners
without his authority. &#8220;I&#8217;ll prefer charges
against the next that does it,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>And not three hours later, Mr. Billy Gray,
sprawling on his camp cot, striving to forget
the sorrow of the earlier morning, and to memorize
a page of paragraphs of army regulations,
was suddenly accosted by an orderly who stood
at the front of the tent, scratching at the tent
flap&mdash;the camp substitute for a ring at the bell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A note for the lieutenant,&#8221; said he, darting
in and then darting out, possibly fearful of
question. It was a queer note:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;I am a total stranger to you, but I wore in
brighter days the badge of the same society
that was yours at the university. Three of the
fraternity are in my company&mdash;one is on guard
and he urged me to write at once to you. They
know me to be a Brother Delt, even though I
dare not tell my real name. What I have to
say is that the charge against me is utterly
false, as I can convince you, but could not convince
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
a court. I am confined at the moment of
all others in my life when it is most vitally
important that I should be free. Grant me ten
minutes&#8217; interview this afternoon and if I do
not prove myself guiltless I will ask no favor&mdash;but
when I <i>do</i> convince you, do as you would
be done by.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right'>Yours in <i>&#923;&nbsp;&#931;&nbsp;&#935;</i>,<br />
<span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>&#8220;George Morton.</span>&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be blessed!&#8221; said Mr. Gray, as he
rolled out of his gray blanket. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a
state of things! Listen to this, captain,&#8221; he
called to his company commander in the adjoining
tent. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Morton, back from forty-eight
hours&#8217; absence without leave, brought
back by armed guard after sharp resistance,
charged with Lord knows what all, wants to
tell me his story and prove his innocence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You let him alone,&#8221; growled his senior.
&#8220;Remember what Canker said, or you&#8217;ll go in
arrest. What call has Morton on you, I&#8217;d like
to know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad flushed. Fraternity was a very
sacred thing in the
<i>&amp;#923;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#931;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#935;</i>.
It was &#8220;the most exclusive crowd at the &#8217;Varsity.&#8221; Its membership
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
was pledged to one another by unusual
ties. It was the hardest society for a fellow to
get into in any one of the seven colleges whereat
it flourished, and its mystic bonds were not
shaken off with the silken gown and &#8220;mortar
board&#8221; of undergraduate days, but followed its
membership through many a maturer year. It
was a society most college men might ask to
join in vain. Money, social station, influence
were powerless. Not until a student had been
under observation two whole years and was
<i>thoroughly</i> known could he hope for a &#8220;bid&#8221; to
become a &#8220;Delta Sig.&#8221; Not until another six
months of probation could he sport its colors,
and not until he formally withdrew from its
fold, in post graduation years, could he consider
himself absolved from its mild obligations. But
the boast of the &#8220;Delta Sig&#8221; had ever been
that no one of its membership had ever turned
a deaf ear to a fellow in need of aid. Who of
its originators ever dreamed of such a thing as
its drifting into and becoming a factor in the
affairs of the regular army?
</p>
<p>No wonder Gray stood for a moment, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
paper still in his hands, irresolute, even disturbed.
Not to answer the appeal meant to
run counter to all the tenets of his fraternity.
To answer might mean arrest and court-martial
for deliberate disobedience of orders. Canker
had no more mercy than an Indian. It was
barely forty-eight hours since he had been publicly
warned by an experienced old captain that
he would find no &#8220;guardian angel&#8221; in Squeers.
It would seriously mar his prospects to start
now with Squeers &#8220;down on him,&#8221; and as that
lynx-eyed commander was ever on watch for
infractions of orders, Billy well knew that he
could not hope to see and talk with the prisoner
and Canker not hear of it. To ask permission
of Canker would only make matters worse&mdash;he
was sure to refuse and then re-emphasize his
orders and redouble his vigilance. To ask the
consent of the officer-of the-day or the connivance
of the officer-of-the-guard was to invite
them to court arrest and trial on their own
account. He couldn&#8217;t do that even to oblige a
brother Delt. If only Ned Craven were officer-of-the-guard
something might be done&mdash;he was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
a college man, too, and though not a &#8220;Delt,&#8221;
but rather of a rival set, he &#8220;would understand&#8221;
and possibly help. Guard mount was
held toward dusk and that was four hours
away, at least. The prisoner&#8217;s note and tone
were urgent. An idea occurred to Billy: What
if he could get Gordon to let <i>him</i> &#8220;go on&#8221; this
very evening? It wasn&#8217;t his tour. He had
&#8220;marched off&#8221; only two days before as he well
remembered, for Canker had &#8220;roughed&#8221; him up
and down about that little error in copying the
list of prisoners from the report of the previous
day. Moreover, he had counted on going to
town right after &#8220;retreat,&#8221; dining at the Palace,
an extravagance not to be thought of at
other times, so as to be on hand when the
Primes and Amy Lawrence came down to dinner.
He had planned it all&mdash;even to the amount
of surprise he was to exhibit when he should
discover about when he had finished his own
dinner that they were just beginning theirs,
and the extent and degree of pleasurable emotion
he might venture on showing as he hastened
over to greet them, and accept their offer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
to be seated with them, even if he had been so
unkind as to dine beforehand <i>solus</i> instead of
with them. He had set his heart on having a chat
with Miss Lawrence as part recompense for all
he had lost that morning, and all this he was
thinking of while still fumbling over that disturbing
note. Time was getting short, too;
there was no telling how much longer they
might stay. Mr. Prime had brought his only
daughter all that long journey across the continent
on the assurance that the boy he loved,
with whom he had quarreled, and whom, in
his anger, he had sorely rebuked, had enlisted
there in San Francisco and was serving in a
regiment at the great camp west of the city.
He had come full of hope and confidence; he
had found the young soldier described, and, in
his bitter disappointment, he declared there was
no resemblance to justify the report sent him
by the boy&#8217;s own uncle, who vowed he had met
him with comrades on the main street of the
city, that the recognition was mutual, for the
boy had darted around the first corner and
escaped. His companions were scattered by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
the time Mr. Lawrence returned to the spot
after a brief, fruitless search, but private detectives
had taken it up and &#8220;located,&#8221; as they
thought, young Prime and telegraphed the
father in the distant East.
</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Lawrence was away on business
of his own. Written assurances that he couldn&#8217;t
be mistaken lost weight, and Mr. Prime, disheartened,
was merely waiting the report of an
agent who thought he had traced the boy to
Tampa. In twenty-four hours he might spirit
his daughter away on another chase, and then
there would be no further warrant for Miss
Lawrence&#8217;s remaining in the city. She would
return to her lovely home in one of the loveliest
of Californian valleys, miles away from the
raw fogs and chills of the Golden Gate, and
would be no more seen among the camps.
That, said Billy Gray to himself, would take
every bit of sunshine from his life.
</p>
<p>All this detail, or much of it, he had learned
from the fair lips of Miss Lawrence herself, for
Mr. Prime and his daughter seemed to shrink
from speaking of the matter. From the first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
Miss Amy had had to take the young gentleman
under her personal wing, as it were. In
her desire to aid her uncle and cousin in every
way, and knowing them to be strangers to the
entire camp, she had eagerly sent for him as
the first familiar or friendly object she saw.
Then when he came and was presented, and
proved to possess little interest to the careworn
man and his anxious and devoted child, it
devolved upon Miss Lawrence to make much
of Billy in proportion as they made little of
him, and for three days or so the blithe young
fellow seemed fairly to walk on air. Moreover,
she had taken him into the family confidences
in telling him of the missing son and brother,
for both her uncle and cousin, she said, were
so sensitive about it they could not talk to any
one except when actually necessary. They had
leaned, as it were, on the General and on Colonel
Armstrong for a day, and then seemed to
draw away from both. They even seemed to
take it much amiss that her father <i>had</i> to be
absent when they came, though they had sent
no word, until too late, of their coming. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
was on his return, might arrive any hour, but
so might they go. Now if Billy could only discover
that missing son&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>Then came an inspiration! Penciling a brief
note he gave it to a soldier of his company and
bade him take it to the guard tents. It told
Morton of the colonel&#8217;s orders, issued that very
day, and bade him be patient&mdash;he hoped and
believed opportunity would be afforded for an
interview that evening. Then he hunted up a
subaltern of his own grade whom he knew
would probably be the detail for officer-of-the-guard
that evening. &#8220;Brooke,&#8221; said he, &#8220;will
you swap tours with me if Gordon&#8217;s willing.
I have&mdash;I&#8217;d like mightily to exchange if it&#8217;s all
the same to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Brooke hesitated. He had social hopes and
aspirations of his own. By &#8220;swapping&#8221; with
Gray he might find himself doomed to a night
in camp when he had accepted for some pleasant
function in town.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought you were keen to go in to-night&mdash;right
after retreat,&#8221; he hazarded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I was,&#8221; said Gray, pulling his drab
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
campaign hat down over his eyes to shut out
the glare of the westering sun. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve got&mdash;a
new wrinkle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some bid for Friday? That&#8217;s your tour,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; And Brooke began counting on his
fingers. &#8220;Wait till I look at my notebook.
Friday? Why, that&#8217;s the night of the Burton&#8217;s
card party&mdash;thought you didn&#8217;t know
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Gray, glad enough to escape
the other question. &#8220;And you hate card parties,
you know you do. It&#8217;s a go, is it? I&#8217;ll see
Gordon at once.&#8221; And off he went, leaving
Brooke to wonder why he should be so bent on
the arrangement.
</p>
<p>But Gordon proved an unexpected foe to the
plan. &#8220;Can&#8217;t be done, Billy,&#8221; said he, sententiously.
&#8220;Canker watches those details like a
hawk. He hasn&#8217;t forgotten you only came off
two days ago, and if I were to mount you
to-night he&#8217;d mount <i>me</i>&mdash;with both feet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think there&#8217;s any use in asking him?&#8221;
queried the boy, tossing a backward glance
toward Canker&#8217;s tent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
&#8220;Not unless you&#8217;re suffering for another
snub. That man loves to say &#8216;no&#8217; as much as
any girl I ever asked, and he doesn&#8217;t do it to
be coaxed, either. Best leave it alone, Billy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then the unexpected happened. Into
the tent with quick, impetuous step, came the
commanding officer himself, and something had
occurred to stir that gentleman to the core. His
eyes were snapping, and his head was high.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gordon,&#8221; said he, &#8220;here&#8217;s more of this
pilfering business, and now they&#8217;re beginning
to find out it isn&#8217;t <i>all</i> in my camp by a damned
sight. I want that letter copied at once.&#8221; Then
with a glance at Gray, who had whipped off his
cap and was standing in respectful attitude, he
changed his tone from the querulous, half-treble
of complaint. &#8220;What&#8217;s this you&#8217;d best leave
alone?&#8221; he suddenly demanded. &#8220;There are
a dozen things you&#8217;d best leave alone and a
dozen you would do well to cultivate and
study. When I was&mdash;however, I never was a
lieutenant except in war-time, when they
amounted to something. I got my professional
knowledge in front of the enemy&mdash;not at any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
damned charity school. You&#8217;re here to ask
some new indulgence, I suppose. Want to
stay in town over night and fritter away your
money and the time the government pays for.
No, sir; you can&#8217;t have my consent. You will
be back in camp at twelve o&#8217;clock, and stop
and report your return to the officer-of-the-guard,
so that I may know the hour you come
in. Who&#8217;s officer-of-the-guard to-night, Mr.
Gordon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Brooke, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Brooke! Why, I thought I told you
he was to take those prisoners in town to-morrow.
He has to testify before that court in the
case of Sergeant Kelly and it saves my sending
another officer and having two of our lieutenants
away from drill and hanging around the
Bohemian Club. Detail somebody else!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, sir,&#8221; answered Gordon imperturbably.
&#8220;Make any odds, sir, who is detailed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Canker had turned to his desk and was tossing
over the papers with nervous hand. Gray
impulsively stepped forward, his eyes kindling
with hope. It was on the tip of his tongue to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
launch into a proffer of his own services for the
detail, but Gordon hastily warned him back
with a sweep of the hand and a portentous
scowl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. One&#8217;s as bad as the other. Next
thing <i>I</i> know some of &#8217;em will be letting prisoners
escape right under my nose, making us
the laughing stock of these damned militia volunteers.&#8221;
(Canker entered service in &#8217;61 as a
private in a city company that was militia to
the tip of its spike-tailed coats, but he had forgotten
it.) &#8220;I want these young idlers to
understand distinctly, by George, that the first
prisoner that gets away from this post takes
somebody&#8217;s commission with him. D&#8217;you hear
<i>that</i>, Mr. Gray?&#8221; And Canker turned and
glared at the bright blue eyes as though he
would like to blast their clear fires with the
breath of his disapprobation. &#8220;Has that young
fellow, Morton, been put in irons yet?&#8221; he suddenly
asked, whirling on Gordon again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think not, sir. Supplies limited. Officer-of-the-day
reported half an hour ago every set
was in use. Sent over to division quartermaster
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
and he answered we had a dozen more&#8217;n we
were entitled to <i>now</i>. Wanted to know &#8217;f we
meant to iron the whole regiment&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The hell he did!&#8221; raged Canker. &#8220;I&#8217;ll settle
<i>that</i> in short order. My horse there, orderly!
I&#8217;ll be back by four, Mr. Gordon. Fix that
detail to suit yourself.&#8221; And so saying the
irascible colonel flung himself out of the tent
and into his saddle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You young idiot,&#8221; said Gordon, whirling
on Billy the moment the coast was clear.
&#8220;You came within an ace of ruining the whole
thing. <i>Never</i> ask Canker for anything, unless
it&#8217;s what you wish to be rid of. Tell Brooke
you&#8217;re for guard, and he&#8217;s to go to town
instead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopping mad,&#8221; as he himself afterward
expressed it, Colonel Canker had ridden over
to &#8220;have it out&#8221; with the quartermaster who
had ventured to comment on his methods, but
the sight of the commanding general, standing
alone at the entrance to his private tent, his
pale face grayer than ever and a world of
trouble in his eyes, compelled Canker to stop
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
short. Two or three orderlies were on the run.
Two aides-de-camp, Mr. Garrison and a comrade
were searching through desks and
boxes, their faces grave and concerned. The
regimental commander was off his horse in a
second. &#8220;Anything amiss, General?&#8221; he asked,
with soldierly salute.
</p>
<p>The General turned slowly toward him.
&#8220;Can our men sell letters,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as
well as food and forage? Do people <i>buy</i> such
things? A most important package has been&mdash;stolen
from my tent.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p>The great thoroughfare of that wonderful
city, seated on more than her seven hills, and
ruling the Western world, was thronged from
curb to curb. Gay with bunting and streamers,
the tall buildings of the rival newspapers
and the long <i>façades</i> of hotels and business
blocks were gayer still with the life and color
and enthusiasm that crowded every window.
Street traffic was blocked. Cable cars clanged
vainly and the police strove valiantly. It was
a day given up to but one duty and one purpose,
that of giving Godspeed to the soldiery ordered
for service in the distant Philippines, and,
though they hailed from almost every section
of the Union except the Pacific slope, as though
they were her own children, with all the hope
and faith and pride and patriotism, with all the
blessings and comforts with which she had
loaded the foremost ships that sailed, yet happily
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
without the tears that flowed when her
own gallant regiment was among the first to
lead the way San Francisco turned out <i>en
masse</i> to cheer the men from far beyond the
Sierras and the Rockies, and to see them
proudly through the Golden Gate. Early
in the day the guns of a famous light battery
had been trundled, decked like some
rose-covered chariot at the summer festival
of flowers, through the winding lanes of
eager forms and faces, the cannoneers almost
dragged from the ranks by the clasping hands
of men and women who seemed powerless to
let go. With their little brown carbines tossed
jauntily over the broad blue shoulders, half a
regiment of regular cavalry, dismounted, had
gone trudging down to the docks, cheered to
the gateway of the pier by thousands of citizens
who seemed to envy the very recruits who,
only half-uniformed and drilled, brought up
the rear of the column. Once within the massive
wooden portals, the guards and sentries
holding back the importunate crowd, the soldiers
flung aside their heavy packs, and were marshalled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
before an array of tempting tables and
there feasted, comforted and rejoiced under the
ministrations of that marvelous successor of the
Sanitary Commission of the great Civil War of
the sixties&mdash;the noble order of the Red Cross.
There at those tables in the dust and din of the
bustling piers, in the soot and heat of the railway
station, in the jam and turmoil at the
ferry houses, in the fog and chill of the seaward
camps, in the fever-haunted wards of crowded
field hospitals, from dawn till dark, from dark
till dawn, toiled week after week devoted
women in every grade of life, the wife of the
millionaire, the daughter of the day laborer,
the gently born, the delicately reared, the social
pets and darlings, the humble seamstress, no
one too high to stoop to aid the departing soldier,
none too poor or low to deny him cheer
and sympathy. The war was still young then.
Spain had not lowered her riddled standard and
sued for peace. Two great fleets had been
swept from the seas, the guns of Santiago were
silenced, and the stronghold of the Orient was
sulking in the shadow of the flag, but there was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
still soldier work to be done, and so long as the
nation sent its fighting men through her broad
and beautiful gates San Francisco and the Red
Cross stood by with eager, lavish hands to heap
upon the warrior sons of a score of other States,
even as upon their own, every cheer and comfort
that wealth could purchase, or human sympathy
devise. It was the one feature of the
war days of &#8217;98 that will never be forgotten.
</p>
<p>At one of the flower-decked tables near the
great &#8220;stage&#8221; that led to the main deck of the
transport, a group of blithe young matrons and
pretty girls had been busily serving fruit, coffee,
<i>bouillon</i> and substantials to the troopers,
man after man, for over two hours. There
was lively chat and merry war of words going
on at the moment between half a dozen young
officers who had had their eyes on that particular
table ever since the coming of the command,
and were now making the most of their
opportunities before the trumpets should sound
the assembly and the word be passed to move
aboard. All the heavy baggage and ammunition
had, at last, been swung into the hold;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
the guns of the battery had been lowered and
securely chocked; the forecastle head was
thronged with the red-trimmed uniforms of the
artillerymen, who had already been embarked
and were now jealously clamoring that the
troopers should be &#8220;shut off&#8221; from the further
ministrations of the Red Cross, and broadly
intimating that it wasn&#8217;t a fair deal that their
rivals should be allowed a whole additional
hour of lingering farewells.
</p>
<p>Lingering farewells there certainly were.
Many a young soldier and many a lass &#8220;paired
off&#8221; in little nooks and corners among the
stacks of bales and boxes, but at the table nearest
the staging all seemed gay good humor.
A merry little woman with straw-colored hair
and pert, tip-tilted nose and much vivacity and
complexion, had apparently taken the lead in
the warfare of chaff and fun. Evidently she
was no stranger to most of the officers. Almost
as evidently, to a very close observer who stood
a few paces away, she was no intimate of the
group of women who with good right regarded
that table as their especial and personal charge.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
Her Red Cross badge was very new; her garb
and gloves were just as fresh and spotless. <i>She</i>
had not been ladling out milk and cream, or
buttering sandwiches, or pinning souvenirs on
dusty blue blouses ever since early morning.
Other faces there showed through all their
smiles and sweetness the traces of long days
of unaccustomed work and short nights of
troubled sleep. Marvelous were Mrs. Frank
Garrison&#8217;s recuperative powers, thought they
who saw her brought home in the Primes&#8217; stylish
carriage, weak and helpless and shaken
after her adventure of the previous day. She
had not been at the Presidio a week, and yet
she pervaded it. She had never thought of
such a thing as the Red Cross until she found
it the center of the social firmament after her
arrival at San Francisco, and here she was, the
last comer, the foremost (&#8220;most forward&#8221; I
<i>think</i> some one described it) in their circle at
one of the most prominent tables, absorbing
much of the attention, most of the glory, and
none of the fatigue that should have been
equally shared by all.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Adios</i>!&#8221; she gayly cried as the &#8220;assembly&#8221;
rang out, loud and clear, and waving their
hands and raising their caps, the officers hastened
to join their commands. &#8220;<i>Adios</i>, till we
meet in Manila.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you <i>really</i> think of going to the Philippines,
Mrs. Garrison?&#8221; queried a much older-looking,
yet younger woman. &#8220;Why, <i>we</i> were
told the General said that none of his staff
would be allowed to take their wives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet there are others!&#8221; laughed Mrs. Garrison,
waving a dainty handkerchief toward the
troops now breaking into column of twos and
slowly climbing the stage. &#8220;Who would <i>want</i>
to go with that blessed old undertaker? Good-by&mdash;<i>bon
voyage</i>, Geordie,&#8221; she cried, blowing
a kiss to the lieutenant at the head of the second
troop, a youth who blushed and looked confused
at the attention thereby centered upon
him, and who would fain have shaken his fist,
rather than waved the one unoccupied hand in
perfunctory reply. &#8220;When <i>I</i> go I&#8217;ll choose a
ship with a band and broad decks, not any such
cramped old canal boat as the Portland.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I thought perhaps your husband&mdash;&#8221; began
the lady dubiously, but with a significant
glance at the silent faces about her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who? Frank Garrison? Heavens! I
haven&#8217;t known what it was to have a husband&mdash;since
that poor dear boy went on staff duty,&#8221;
promptly answered the diminutive center of
attraction, a merry peal of laughter ringing
under the dingy archway of the long, long
roof. &#8220;Why, the Portland has only one stateroom
in it big enough for a bandbox, and of
course the General has to have that, and there
isn&#8217;t a deck where one couple could turn a slow
waltz. No, indeed! wait for the next flotilla,
when <i>our</i> fellows go, bands and all. <i>Then</i>
we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely, Mrs. Garrison, we are told the
War Department has positively forbidden officers&#8217;
wives from going on the transports&#8221;&mdash;again
began her interrogator, a wistful look in
her tired eyes. &#8220;I know I&#8217;d give <i>anything</i>
to join Mr. Dutton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The War Department has to take orders
quite as often as it gives them, Mrs. Dutton.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
The thing is to know how to be of the order-giving
side. Oh, joy!&#8221; she suddenly cried.
&#8220;Here are the Primes and Amy Lawrence&mdash;then
the regiments must be coming! And
there&#8217;s Stanley Armstrong!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Far up the westward street the distant roar
of voices mingled with the swing and rhythm
and crash of martial music. Dock policemen
and soldiers on guard began boring a wide lane
through the throng of people on the pier. A
huge black transport ship lay moored along the
opposite side to that on which the guns and
troopers were embarked, and for hours bales,
boxes and barrels had been swallowed up and
stored in her capacious depths until now, over
against the tables of the Red Cross, there lay
behind a rope barrier, taut stretched and guarded
by a line of sentries, an open space close under
the side of the greater steamer and between the
two landing stages, placed fore and aft. By
this time the north side of the broad pier was
littered with the inevitable relics of open air
lunching, and though busy hands had been at
work and the tables had been cleared, and fresh
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
white cloths were spread and everything <i>on</i> the
tables began again to look fair and inviting,
the good fairies themselves looked askance at
their bestrewn surroundings. &#8220;Oh, if we could
only move everything bodily over to the other
side,&#8221; wailed Madam President, as from her
perch on a stack of Red Cross boxes she surveyed
that coveted stretch of clean, unhampered
flooring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not?&#8221; chirruped Mrs. Garrison,
from a similar perch, a tier or two higher.
&#8220;Here are men enough to move mountains.
All we have to do is to say the word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the other, gazing
wistfully about over the throng of faces, as
though in search of some one sufficient in rank
and authority to serve her purpose. &#8220;We plead
in vain with the officer-of-the-guard. He says
his orders are imperative&mdash;to allow no one to
intrude on that space,&#8221; and madam looked as
though she would rather look anywhere than at
the animated sprite above her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense!&#8221; shrilled Mrs. Garrison.
&#8220;Here, Cherry,&#8221; she called to a pretty girl,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
standing near the base of the pile, &#8220;give me my
bag. I&#8217;m army woman enough to know that
order referred only to the street crowd that
sometimes works in on the pier and steals.&#8221;
The bag was duly passed up to her. She cast
one swift glance over the heads of the crowd to
where a handsome carriage was slowly working
its way among the groups of prettily
dressed women and children&mdash;friends and relatives
of members of the departing commands,
in whose behalf, as though by special dispensation,
the order excluding all but soldiers and
the Red Cross had been modified. Already the
lovely dark-eyed girl on the near side had
waved her hand in greeting, responding to
Mrs. Garrison&#8217;s enthusiastic signals, but her
companion, equally lovely, though of far different
type, seemed preoccupied, perhaps unwilling
to see, for her large, dark, thoughtful eyes
were engaged with some object on the opposite
side&mdash;not even with the distinguished looking
soldier who sat facing her and talking quietly
at the moment with Mr. Prime. There was a
gleam of triumph in Mrs. Garrison&#8217;s dancing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
eyes as she took out a flat notebook and pencil
and dashed off a few lines in bold and vigorous
strokes. Tearing out the page, she rapidly read
it over, folded it and glanced imperiously about
her. A cavalry sergeant, one of the home troop
destined to remain at the Presidio, was leaning
over the edge of the pier, hanging on to an iron
ring and shouting some parting words to comrades
on the upper deck, but her shrill soprano
cut through the dull roar of deep, masculine
voices and the tramp of feet on resounding
woodwork.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sergeant!&#8221; she cried, with quick decision.
&#8220;Take this over to the officer in command of
that guard. Then bring a dozen men and move
these two tables across the pier.&#8221; The cavalryman
glanced at the saucy little woman in the
stunning costume, &#8220;took in&#8221; the gold crossed
sabres, topped by a regimental number in brilliants
that pinned her martial collar at the
round, white throat, noted the ribbon and pin
and badge of the Red Cross, and the symbol of
the Eighth Corps in red enamel and gold upon
the breast of her jacket, and above all the ring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
of accustomed authority in her tone, and never
hesitated a second. Springing to the pile of
boxes he grasped the paper; respectfully raised
his cap, and bored his stalwart way across the
pier. In three minutes he was back&mdash;half a
dozen soldiers at his heels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;ll you have &#8217;em, ma&#8217;am&mdash;miss?&#8221; he
asked, as the men grasped the supports and
raised the nearmost table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Straight across and well over to the edge,&#8221;
she answered, in the same crisp tones of command.
Then, with total and instant change of
manner, &#8220;I suppose <i>your</i> tables should go first,
Madam President,&#8221; she smilingly said. &#8220;It
shall be as you wish about the others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And the Red Cross was vanquished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare,&#8221; said an energetic official, a
moment later, leaning back on her throne of
lemon boxes, and fanning herself vigorously,
&#8220;for a whole hour I&#8217;ve been trying to move
that officer&#8217;s heart and convince him the order
didn&#8217;t apply to us. Now how did&mdash;she&mdash;do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The officer must be some old&mdash;some personal
friend,&#8221; hazarded the secretary, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
quick feminine comprehensive glance at the
little lady now being lifted up to shake hands
with the carriage folk, after being loaded with
compliments and congratulations by the ladies
of the two favored tables.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; was the prompt reply. &#8220;He is
a volunteer officer she never set eyes on before
to-day. I <i>would</i> like to know what was on that
paper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But now the roar of cheering and the blare
of martial music had reached the very gateway.
The broad portals were thrown open and
in blue and brown, crushed and squeezed by the
attendant throng, the head of the column of
infantry came striding on to the pier. The
band, wheeling to one side, stood at the entrance,
playing them in, the rafters ringing to
the stirring strains of &#8220;The Liberty Bell.&#8221;
They were still far down the long pier, the
sloping rifles just visible, dancing over the
heads of the crowd. No time was to be lost.
More tables were to be carried, but&mdash;who but
that&mdash;&#8220;that little army woman&#8221; could give the
order so that it would be obeyed. Not one bit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
did the president like to do it, but something
had to be done to obtain the necessary order,
for the soldiers who so willingly and promptly
obeyed her beck and call were now edging
away for a look at the newcomers, and Mrs.
Frank Garrison, perched on the carriage step
and chatting most vivaciously with its occupants
and no longer concerning herself, apparently,
about the Red Cross or its tables, had
the gratification of finding herself approached,
quite as she had planned, by two most prominent
and distinguished women of San Francisco
society, and requested to issue instructions
as to the moving of the other tables.
&#8220;Certainly, ladies,&#8221; she responded, with charming
smiles. &#8220;Just <i>one</i> minute, Mildred. Don&#8217;t
drive farther yet,&#8221; and within that minute half
a dozen boys in blue were lugging at the first
of the tables still left on the crowded side of
the dock, and others still were bearing oil stoves,
urns and trays. In less time than it takes to
tell it the entire Red Cross equipage was on its
way across the pier, and when the commanding
officer of the arriving regiment reached the spot
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
which he had planned to occupy with his band,
his staff and all his officers, there in state and
ceremony to receive the citizens who came in
swarms to bid them farewell, he found it occupied
by as many as eight snowy, goody-laden
tables, presided over by as many as eighty
charming maids and matrons, all ready and
eager to comfort and revive the inner man of
his mighty regiment with coffee and good cheer
illimitable, and the colonel swore a mighty oath
and pounced on his luckless officer-of-the-guard.
He had served as a subaltern many a year in
the old army, and knew how it was done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I give you personal and positive
orders not to let anything or anybody occupy
this space after the baggage was got aboard,
sir?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did, sir,&#8221; said the unabashed lieutenant,
pulling a folded paper from his belt, &#8220;and
the Red Cross got word to the general and
what the Red Cross says&mdash;<i>goes</i>. Look at
that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The colonel looked, read, looked dazed,
scratched his head and said: &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
damned!&#8221; Then he turned to his adjutant.
&#8220;You were with me when I saw the general
last night and he told me to put this guard on
and keep this space clear. Now, what d&#8217;you
say to that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The adjutant glanced over the penciled lines.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if you s&#8217;pose any order
that discriminates against the Red Cross is
going to hold good, once they find it out, you&#8217;re
bound to get left. They&#8217;re feasting the first
company now, sir; shall I have it stopped?&#8221;
and there was a grin under the young soldier&#8217;s
mustache. The colonel paused one moment,
shook his head and concluded he, too, would
better grin and bear it. Taking the paper in
his hand again he heard his name called and
saw smiling faces and beckoning hands in an
open carriage near him, but the sight of Stanley
Armstrong, signalling to him from another,
farther away, had something dominant about
it. &#8220;With you in a minute,&#8221; he called to those
who first had summoned him. &#8220;What is it,
Armstrong?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to present you to some friends of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
mine&mdash;Miss Lawrence&mdash;Miss Prime&mdash;Mr.
Prime&mdash;my old associate, Colonel Stewart.
Pardon me, Mrs. Garrison. I did not see you
had returned.&#8221; She had, and was once more
perched upon the step. &#8220;Mrs. Garrison&mdash;Colonel
Stewart. What we need to know, Stewart,
is this: Will all your men board the ship by
this stage, or will some go aft?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All by <i>this</i> stage&mdash;why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the colonel felt a somewhat massive hand
crushing down on his own and forebore to press
the question. Armstrong let no pause ensue.
He spoke, rapidly for him, bending forward,
too, and speaking low; but even as she chatted
and laughed, the little woman on the carriage
step saw, even though she did not seem to look,
heard, even though she did not seem to listen:
</p>
<p>&#8220;An awkward thing has happened. The
General&#8217;s tent was robbed of important papers
perhaps two days ago, and the guardhouse rid
of a most important prisoner last night. Canker
has put the officer-of-the-guard in arrest. Remember
good old Billy Gray who commanded
us at Apache? This is Billy Junior, and I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
awful sorry.&#8221; Here the soft gray eyes glanced
quickly at the anxious face of Miss Lawrence,
who sat silently feigning interest in the chat
between the others. The anxious look in her
eyes increased at Armstrong&#8217;s next words:
&#8220;The prisoner must have had friends. He
is now said to be among your men, disguised,
and those two fellows at the stage are detectives.
I thought all that space was to be kept
clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; answered Stewart, &#8220;yet the chief
must have been overpersuaded. Look here!&#8221;
and the colonel held forth a scrap of paper.
Amy Lawrence, hearing something like the
gasp of a sufferer in sudden pain, turned
quickly and saw that every vestige of color had
left Mrs. Garrison&#8217;s face&mdash;that she was almost
reeling on the step. Before she could call attention
to it, Armstrong, who had taken and
glanced curiously at the scrap, whirled suddenly,
and his eyes, in stern menace, swept the
spot where the little lady clung but an instant
before. As suddenly Mrs. Garrison had sprung
from the step and vanished.

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p>Billy Gray was indeed in close arrest and
the grim prophecy was fulfilled&mdash;Colonel Canker
was proving &#8220;anything but a guardian angel
to him.&#8221; The whole regiment, officers and
men, barring only the commander, was practically
in mourning with sorrow for him and
chagrin over its own discomfiture. Not only
one important prisoner was gone, but two; not
only two, but four. No man in authority was
able to say just when or how it happened, for
it was Canker&#8217;s own order that the prisoners
should not be paraded when the guard fell in at
night. They were there at tattoo and at taps &#8220;all
secure.&#8221; The officer of the guard, said several
soldiers, had quite a long talk with one of the
prisoners&mdash;young Morton&mdash;just after tattoo, at
which time the entire guard had been inspected
by the commanding officer himself. But at
reveille four most important prisoners were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
gone and, such was Canker&#8217;s wrath, not only
was Gray in arrest, but the sergeant of
the guard also, while the three luckless men
who were successively posted as sentries during
the night at the back of the wooden shell that
served as a guardhouse&mdash;were now in close confinement
in the place of the escaped quartette.
</p>
<p>Yet those three were men who had hitherto
been above suspicion, and there were few soldiers
in the regiment who would accept the
theory that any one of the three had connived
at the escape. As for the sergeant&mdash;he had
served four enlistments in the &mdash;teenth, and
without a flaw in his record beyond an occasional
aberration in the now distant past, due
to the potency of the poteen distilled by certain
Hibernian experts not far from an old-time
&#8220;plains fort,&#8221; where the regiment had rested on
its march &#8217;cross continent. As for the officers&mdash;but
who would suppose an officer guilty of
anything of the kind&mdash;a flagrant military
crime? And yet&mdash;men got to asking each other
if it were so that Bugler Curran had carried
a note from the prisoner, Morton, to Mr. Gray
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
about 2:30 that afternoon? And what was this
about Gray&#8217;s having urged Brooke to swap
tours with him an hour later, and what was
that story the headquarters clerks were telling
about Mr. Gray&#8217;s coming to the adjutant and
begging to be allowed to &#8220;march on&#8221; that
evening instead of Brooke? It wasn&#8217;t long
before these rumors, somehow, got to Canker&#8217;s
ears, and Canker seemed to grow as big again;
he fairly swelled with indignation at thought
of such turpitude on part of an officer. Then
he sent for Gray&mdash;it was the afternoon following
the sailing of the ships with the big brigade&mdash;and
with pain and bewilderment and indignation
in his brave blue eyes the youngster
came and stood before his stern superior. Gordon,
who sent the message, and who had heard
Canker&#8217;s denunciatory remarks, had found time
to scribble a word or two&mdash;&#8220;Admit nothing;
say nothing; <i>do</i> nothing but hold your tongue
and temper. If C. insists on answers say you
decline except in presence of your legal adviser.&#8221;
So there was a scene in the commander&#8217;s
tent that afternoon. The morning had not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
been without its joys. Along about ten o&#8217;clock
as Gray sat writing to his father in his little
canvas home, he heard a voice that sent the
blood leaping through his veins and filled his
eyes with light. Springing from his campstool
and capsizing it as he did so, he poked his curly
head from the entrance of the tent&mdash;and there
she was&mdash;only a dozen feet away&mdash;Major Lane
in courteous attendance, Mr. Prime sadly following,
and Miss Prime quite content with the
devotions of Captain Schuyler. Only a dozen
feet away and coming straight to him, with
frank smiles and sympathy in her kind and winsome
face&mdash;with hand outstretched the moment
she caught sight of him. &#8220;We wanted to come
when we heard of it yesterday, Mr. Gray,&#8221; said
Amy Lawrence, &#8220;but it was dark when we got
back from seeing the fleet off, and uncle was
too tired in the evening. Indeed we are all
very, very sorry!&#8221; And poor Billy never heard
or cared what the others said, so absorbed was
he in drinking in her gentle words and gazing
into her soft, dark eyes. No wonder he found
it difficult to release her hand. That brief visit,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
filled with sweetness and sunshine, ought to
have been a blessing to him all day long, but
Canker caught sight of the damsels as they
walked away on the arms of the attendant cavaliers&mdash;Miss
Lawrence more than once smiling
back at the incarcerated Billy&mdash;and Canker
demanded to be informed who they were and
where they had been, and Gordon answered
they were Miss Lawrence of Santa Anita, and
Miss Prime of New York&mdash;and he &#8220;reckoned&#8221;
they must have been in to condole with Mr.
Gray&mdash;whereat Canker snarled that people
ought to know better than to visit officers in
arrest&mdash;it was tantamount to disrespect to the
commander. It was marvelous how many
things in Canker&#8217;s eyes were disrespectful.
</p>
<p>So he heard these stories with eager ears and
sent for Gray, and thought to bully him into an
admission or confession, but Gordon&#8217;s words
had &#8220;stiffened&#8221; the little fellow to the extent
of braving Canker&#8217;s anger and telling him he
had said all he proposed to say when the colonel
called him up the previous day. The result
of that previous interview was his being placed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
in close arrest and informed that he should be
tried by general court-martial once. So he had
taken counsel, as was his right, and &#8220;counsel&#8221;
forbade his committing himself in any way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you refuse to divulge the contents of
that note and to say why you were so eager to
go on guard out of your turn?&#8221; said Canker,
oracularly. &#8220;That in itself is sufficient to convince
any fair-minded court of your guilt, sir.&#8221;
Whereat Gordon winked at Billy and put his
tongue in his cheek&mdash;and Billy stood mute until
ordered, with much asperity, to go back to his
tent.
</p>
<p>But there were other things that might well
go toward convincing a court of the guilt of
Lieutenant Gray, and poor Billy contemplated
them with sinking heart. Taking prompt advantage
of his position as officer of the guard,
he had caused the young prisoner to be brought
outside the guardhouse, and as a heavy, dripping
fog had come on the wings of the night
wind, sailing in from the sea, he had led the
way to the sheltered side, which happened to
be the darkest one, of the rude little building,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
and had there bidden him tell his story. But
Morton glanced uneasily at a sentry who followed
close and was hovering suspiciously
about. &#8220;I cannot talk about&mdash;the affair&mdash;with
that fellow spying,&#8221; he said, with an eager plea
in his tone and a sign of the hand that Gray
well knew and quickly recognized. &#8220;Keep
around in front. I&#8217;ll be responsible for this
prisoner,&#8221; were his orders, and, almost reluctantly,
the man left. He was a veteran soldier,
and his manner impressed the lieutenant with
a vague sense of trouble. Twice the sentry
glanced back and hesitated, as though something
were on his mind that he must tell, but
finally he disappeared and kept out of the way
during the brief interview that immediately followed.
The prisoner eagerly, excitedly began
his explanation&mdash;swiftly banishing any lingering
doubts Gray might have entertained as to
his innocence. But he had come from a stove-heated
guardroom into the cold sea wind off
the Pacific&mdash;into the floating wisps of vapor
that sent chill to the marrow. He was far too
lightly clad for that climate, and presently he
began to shiver.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are cold,&#8221; said Gray, pityingly.
&#8220;Have you no overcoat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s at my tent&mdash;I never expected to spend
this night here. I&#8217;ve been before the summary
court, fined for absence, and thought that would
end it, but instead of that I&#8217;m a prisoner and
the man who should be here is stalking about
camp, planning more robberies. Yet I&#8217;d rather
associate with the very worst of the deserters
or dead beats inside there,&#8221; and the dark eyes
glanced almost in horror&mdash;the slender figure
shook with mingled repulsion and chill&mdash;&#8220;than
with that smooth-tongued sneak and liar.
There&#8217;s no crime too mean for him to commit,
Mr. Gray, and the men are beginning to know
it, though the colonel won&#8217;t. For God&#8217;s sake
get me out of this before morning&mdash;&#8221; And
again the violent tremor shook the lad from
head to foot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&mdash;get inside!&#8221; said Gray impulsively.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll see the adjutant at once and return to you
in a few minutes. If you have to remain until
the matter can be investigated by the General it
might be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It would be&mdash;&#8221; vehemently interrupted
Morton, then breaking off short as though at
loss for descriptive of sufficient strength. He
seemed to swell with passion as he clinched his
fists and fairly stood upon his toes an instant,
his strong white teeth grinding together. &#8220;It
would be&mdash;simply hell!&#8221; he burst in again,
hoarse and quivering. &#8220;It would ruin&mdash;everything!
Can&#8217;t the General give the order to-night?&#8221;
he asked with intense eagerness, while
the young officer, taking him by the arm, had
led him again to the light of the guardhouse
lamps at the front. The sergeant and a group
of soldiers straightened up and faced them, listening
curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be even impossible to see the General,&#8221;
answered Gray doubtfully. &#8220;Take Morton
into the guardroom till I get back, sergeant,
and let him warm himself thoroughly.&#8221;
Don&#8217;t put him with the prisoners till I return,
and so saying he had hastened away. Gordon,
his friend and adviser, had left camp and gone
visiting over in the other division. The lights at
general headquarters were turned low. Even
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
now, after having heard proofs of the innocence
of the accused soldier, Gray knew that it was
useless to appeal to the colonel. He could not
understand, however, the feverish, almost insane,
impatience of the lad for immediate release.
Another day ought not to make so great
a difference. What could be the reason&mdash;if it
were not that, though innocent of the robbery
of the storehouse, or of complicity in the sale
of stolen goods, some other crime lay at his
door which the morrow might disclose? All the
loyalty of a Delta Sig was stretched to the
snapping point as Gray paused irresolute in
front of the adjutant&#8217;s tent, his quest there
unsuccessful. The sergeant-major and a sorely
badgered clerk were working late over some
regimental papers&mdash;things that Morton wrote
out easily and accurately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose, sir, it&#8217;s no use asking to have the
prisoner sent up here under guard,&#8221; said that
jewel of a noncommissioned officer. &#8220;Yet the
colonel will be savage if these papers ain&#8217;t
ready. It will take us all night as things are
going.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>Gray shook his curly head. &#8220;Go ask, if you
like, but&mdash;Morton&#8217;s in no shape to help
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he been drinking, sir?&#8221; said the sergeant-major,
in surprise. &#8220;I never knew
him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; said Gray hastily, &#8220;only
he&#8217;s&mdash;he&#8217;s got&mdash;other matters on his mind!
Bring me his overcoat. He said it was in his
tent,&#8221; and the young officer jerked his head at
the patch of little &#8220;A&#8221; tents lined up in the
rear of those of the officers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get Morton&#8217;s overcoat and take it to him at
the guardhouse,&#8221; snapped the staff sergeant to
the clerk. &#8220;Be spry now, and no stopping on
the way back,&#8221; he added&mdash;well aware how
much in need his assistant stood of creature
comfort of some surreptitious and forbidden
kind. The man was back in a moment, the
coat rolled on his arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it,&#8221; said Gray simply. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on with it!&#8221; ordered the sergeant as the
soldier hesitated. &#8220;D&#8217;ye think the service has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
gone to the devil and officers are runnin&#8217;
errands for enlisted men? An&#8217; get back inside
two minutes, too,&#8221; he added with portent in
his tone. The subaltern of hardly two months&#8217;
service felt the implied rebuke of the soldier of
over twenty years&#8217; and meekly accepted the
amendment, but&mdash;a thought occurred to him:
He had promised Morton paper, envelopes and
stamps and the day&#8217;s newspapers&mdash;the lad
seemed strangely eager to get all the latter, and
vaguely Billy remembered having heard that
Canker considered giving papers to prisoners
as equivalent to aid and comfort to the enemy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it by way of my tent,&#8221; said he as they
started, and, once there it took time to find
things. &#8220;Go back to the sergeant-major and
tell him I sent you,&#8221; said Gray, after another
search. &#8220;He needs you on those papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And when the officer of the guard returned
to the guardhouse and went in to the prisoner,
the sergeant saw&mdash;and others saw&mdash;that, rolled
in the soldier&#8217;s overcoat he carried on his arm,
was a bundle done up in newspaper. Moreover,
a scrap of conversation was overheard.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no one at the General&#8217;s,&#8221; said the
officer. &#8220;I see no way of&mdash;fixing it before morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My God, lieutenant! There&mdash;must be some
way out of it! The morning will be too late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll do what I can for you to-night,&#8221;
said Mr. Gray as he turned and hurriedly left
the guardroom&mdash;a dozen men standing stiffly
about the walls and doorway and staring with
impassive faces straight to the front. Again,
the young officer had left the post of the guard
and gone up into camp, while far and near
through the dim, fog-swept aisles of a score of
camps the bugles and trumpets were wailing
the signal for &#8220;lights out,&#8221; and shadowy forms
with coat collars turned up about the ears or
capes muffled around the neck, scurried about
the company streets ordering laughter and talk
to cease. A covered carriage was standing at
the curb outside the officers&#8217; gate&mdash;as a certain
hole in the fence was designated&mdash;and the sentry
there posted remembered that the officer of
the guard came hurrying out and asked the
driver if he was engaged. &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for
the major,&#8221; was the answer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, where can one order a carriage to-night
without going clear to town?&#8221; inquired
Gray. &#8220;I want one&mdash;that is&mdash;I wish to order
one at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And the driver who knew very well there
were several places where carriages could be had,
preferred loyalty to his own particular stable
away in town, and so declared there was none.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can telephone there, if you wish, sir,&#8221;
he added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And wait till morning for it to get here?
No! I&#8217;ll get it&mdash;somehow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And that he did get it somehow was current
rumor on the following day, for the sentries on
the guardhouse side of camp swore that a
closed carriage drove down from McAllister
Street for all the world as though it had just
come out of the park, and rolled on past the
back of the guardhouse, the driver loudly
whistling &#8220;Killarney,&#8221; so that it could be heard
above the crunching of the wheels through the
rough, loose rock that covered the road, and
that carriage drew up not a hundred yards
away, while the lieutenant was out visiting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
sentries, and presently they saw him coming
back along the walk, stopping to question each
sentry as to his orders. Then he returned and
inquired if all was quiet among the prisoners,
and then went and put out his light in the tent
reserved for the officer of the guard, and once
more left his post, briefly informing the sergeant
of the guard he was going to the
officer of the day. Then it was ascertained
that he had visited half a dozen places in search
of that veteran captain, and appeared much disturbed
because he could not find him. In half
an hour he was back, asking excitedly of the
sentry in rear of the guardhouse if a carriage
had come that way. It had, said the sentry,
and was waiting down the street. Gray hurried
in the direction indicated, was gone perhaps
three minutes, and returned, saying that
the sentry must be mistaken, that no carriage
was there. But the sentry reiterated his statement
that it had been there and had been waiting
for some time, and must have disappeared
while he was temporarily around at the opposite
side of the building. This was about 11
<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>P.M.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>Then when Gray appeared at reveille Morton
had disappeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the sergeant let them fellers out,&#8221;
said the regimental oracles. &#8220;This is no ten-dollar
subscription business.&#8221; And so until
late in the afternoon the question that agitated
the entire range of regimental camps was:
&#8220;How did those fellows break away from the
prison of the &mdash;teenth?&#8221; Then came a clue,
and then&mdash;discovery.
</p>
<p>By order of Lieutenant-Colonel Canker a
board of officers had been convened to investigate
the matter, and after questioning everybody
whom &#8220;Squeers&#8221; had already badgered
with his assertions, threats and queries, they
went to the guardhouse and began a thorough
inspection of the premises. The wooden building
stood in the midst of a waste of sand blown
in from the shore line by the strong sea wind.
It was perched on something like a dozen stout
posts driven into the soft soil and then the space
between the floor level and the sand was heavily
and stoutly boarded in&mdash;thick planks being
used. Between the floor and the sand was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
space of about eighteen inches vertical, and a
dozen men could have sprawled therein&mdash;lying
at full length&mdash;but to escape would have required
the connivance of one or more of the
sentries surrounding the building and the ripping
off of one or more of the planks. In his keen
anxiety Canker accompanied the Board on its
tour of investigation&mdash;a thing the Board did not
at all like&mdash;and presently, as was his wont, began
running things his own way. It had been
found useless to question the soldiers of the
guard. Not a man could be found to admit he
knew the faintest thing about the escape. As
for the prisoners, most of them reckless, devil-may-care
rascals, they grinned or leered suggestively,
but had nothing to tell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have this boarding ripped off,&#8221; said
Canker decisively, &#8220;and see what they&#8217;ve got
secreted under there. I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised
to find a whisky still in full blast, or a complete
gambling outfit&mdash;dash, dash &#8217;em to dash
and dashnation! Send for a carpenter, sergeant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The carpenter came, and he and two or three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
of the guard laid hold of one end of the plank
after its nails were drawn, and with little exertion
ripped it off the other posts. Then everybody
held his breath a minute, stared, and a
small majority swore. So far from its being
open to cats, cans and rubbish, the space on that
side was filled solid with damp, heavy sea sand&mdash;a
vertical wall extending from floor to
ground. Canker almost ran around to the
opposite side and had a big plank torn off there.
Within was a wall as damp, solid and straight
as that first discovered, and so, when examined,
were the other two sides provided. Canker&#8217;s
face was a study, and the Board gazed and was
profoundly happy.
</p>
<p>At last the colonel exploded:
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jupiter! They haven&#8217;t got away at all,
then! There isn&#8217;t a flaw in the sand wall anywhere.
They must be hiding about the middle
now. Come on, gentlemen,&#8221; and around he
trotted to the front door. &#8220;Sergeant,&#8221; he cried,
&#8220;get out all the prisoners&mdash;all their bedding&mdash;every
blessed thing they&#8217;ve got. I want to
examine that floor.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>Most of the guardhouse &#8220;birds&#8221; were out
chopping wood, and Canker danced in among
the few remaining, loading them with bedding
belonging to their fellows until every item of
clothing and furniture was shoved out of the
room. One member of the Board and one only
failed to enter with his associates&mdash;a veteran
captain who read much war literature and abhorred
Canker. To the surprise of the sentry
he walked deliberately over to the fence,
climbed it and presently began poking about
the wooden curb that ran along the road, making
a low revetment or retaining wall for the
earth, cinders and gravel that, distributed over
the sand, had been hopefully designated a sidewalk
by the owners of the tract. Presently he
came sauntering back, and both sentries within
easy range would have sworn he was chuckling.
Canker greeted him with customary
asperity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, sir, by absenting yourself
from this investigation, when you must
have known I was with the Board and giving
it the benefit of the information I had gathered?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was merely expediting matters, colonel.
While you were looking for where they went in
I was finding where they got out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Went in <i>what</i>? Got out of what?&#8221; snapped
Canker.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Their tunnel, sir. It&#8217;s Libby on a small
scale over again. They must have been at
work at it at least ten days.&#8221; And as he spoke,
calmly ignoring Canker and letting his eyes
wander over the floor, the veteran battalion
commander sauntered across the room, stirred
up a slightly projecting bit of flooring with the
toe of his boot and placidly continued. &#8220;If
you&#8217;ll be good enough to let the men pry this
up you <i>may</i> understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And when pried up and lifted away&mdash;a
snugly fitting trapdoor about two feet square&mdash;there
yawned beneath it, leading slantwise
downward in the direction of the street, a tunnel
through the soft yielding sand, braced and
strengthened here and there with lids and sides
of cracker-boxes. &#8220;Now, if you don&#8217;t mind straddling
a fence, sir, I&#8217;ll show you the other end,&#8221;
said the captain, imperturbably leading the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
way, and Canker, half-dazed yet wholly in
command of his stock of blasphemy, followed.
At the curb, right in the midst of a lot of loose
hay from the bales dumped there three days
before, the leader dislodged with his sword the
top of a clothing box that had been thickly
covered with sand and hay&mdash;and there was the
outlet. &#8220;Easy as rolling off a log, colonel,&#8221;
said old Cobb, with a sarcastic grin. &#8220;This
could all be done without a man you&#8217;ve blamed
and arrested being a whit the wiser. They
sawed a panel out of the floor, scooped the sand
out of this tunnel, banked it solid against the
weather boarding inside, filled up the whole
space, pretty near, but ran their tunnel under
fence and sidewalk, crawled down the gutter to
the next block out of sight of the sentries, then
walked away free men. Those three thieves
who got away were old hands. The other men
in the guardhouse were only mild offenders,
except Morton. &#8217;Course he was glad of the
chance to go with &#8217;em. I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;ll release
my sergeant and those sentries now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do nothing of the kind,&#8221; answered Canker,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
red with wrath, &#8220;and your suggestion is
disrespectful to your commanding officer.
When I want your advice I&#8217;ll ask for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Gray will be relieved to learn of
this anyhow. I suppose I may tell <i>him</i>,&#8221; hazarded
the junior member, mischievously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gray be &mdash;&mdash;. Mr. Gray has everything
to answer for!&#8221; shouted the angered colonel.
&#8220;It was he who telephoned for a carriage
to meet and run those rascals off. Mr. Gray&#8217;s
fate is sealed. He can thank God I don&#8217;t slap
him into the guardhouse with his chosen associates,
but <i>he</i> shan&#8217;t escape. Sergeant of the
guard, post a sentry over Lieutenant Gray&#8217;s
tent, with orders to allow no one to enter or
leave it without my written authority. Mr.
Gray shall pay for this behind the prison bars
of Alcatraz.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p>Social circles at West Point at long, rare
intervals are shocked by a scandal, and at short
ones, say every other summer&mdash;are stirred by
some kind of a sensation, and the &#8220;Fairy Sisters&#8221;
were the sensation of the year &#8217;97. They
came in July; they went in September, and
meanwhile they were &#8220;on the go,&#8221; as they expressed
it, from morn till late at night. Physically
they were the lightest weights known to
the hop room. Mentally, as their admirers in
the corps expressed it, &#8220;either of them can take
a fall out of any woman at the Point,&#8221; and this
was especially true of the elder&mdash;Mrs. Frank
Garrison&mdash;whose husband was on staff duty in
the far West. Both were slight, fragile, tiny
blondes with light blue eyes, with lighter, fluffy
hair, with exquisite little hands and feet, with
oval, prettily shaped faces, and the younger&mdash;the
maiden sister, had a bewitching mouth and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
regular, snowy dots of teeth of which she was
justly proud. Yet, as has been previously said
of Mrs. Frank, while the general effect was in
the case of each that of an extremely pretty
young girl, the elder had no really good features,
the younger only that one. They generally
dressed very much alike in light, flimsy
gowns, and hats, gloves and summer shoes all
of dazzling white&mdash;sometimes verging for a
change to a creamy hue&mdash;but colors, except for
sashes or summer shawls, seemed banished
from their wardrobes. They danced divinely,
said the corps, and preferred cadet partners, to
the joy of the battalion. They rode fearlessly
and well, and had stunning hats and habits,
but few opportunities for display thereof. They
came tripping down the path from the hotel
every morning, fresh and fair as daisies, in
time for guard mounting, and at any hour after
that could be found chatting with cadet friends
at the visitors&#8217; tent, strolling arm in arm about
the shaded walks with some of their many
admirers until time to dress for the evening hop,
where they never missed a dance, and on rainy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
days, or on those evenings when there was neither
hop nor band practice, they could be found,
each in some dimly lighted, secluded nook
about the north or west piazza or on the steps
leading down to the &#8220;Chain Battery Walk,&#8221;
sometimes surrounded by a squad of cadet
friends, but more frequently in murmured <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with only one cavalier. In the case of
Mrs. Frank no member of the corps seemed
especially favored. She was just the same to
every one. In the case of her younger sister&mdash;Miss
Terriss&mdash;there presently developed a dashing
young cadet captain who so scientifically
conducted his campaign that he headed off
almost all competitors and was presently accorded
the lead under the universally accepted
theory that he had won the little lady&#8217;s heart.
Observant women&mdash;and what women are not
observant&mdash;of each other?&mdash;declared both sisters
to be desperate flirts. Society at the Point
frowned upon them and, after the first formal
call or two, dropped them entirely&mdash;a thing
they never seemed to resent in the least, or even
to notice. They were never invited out to tea
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
or dinner on the post&mdash;solemn functions nowhere
near so palatable as the whispered homage
of stalwart young manhood. &#8220;Nita is yet
such a child she infinitely prefers cadet society,
and I always did like boys,&#8221; explained Mrs.
Garrison. Some rather gay old boys used to
run up Saturday afternoons on the Mary Powell
and spend Sunday at the Point&mdash;Wall Street
men of fifty years and much lucre. &#8220;Dear old
friends of father&#8217;s,&#8221; Mrs. Frank used to say,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ve simply got to entertain them.&#8221; Entertained
they certainly were, for her wit and
vivacity were acknowledged on every side, and
entertained not only collectively, but severally,
for she always managed to give each his hour&#8217;s
confidential chat, and on the Sundays of their
coming had no time to spare for cadet friends.
Moreover, she always drove down in the big
&#8217;bus with them Monday morning when the
Powell was sighted coming along that glorious
reach from Polopel&#8217;s Island, and stood at the
edge of the wharf waving her tiny kerchief&mdash;even
blowing fairy kisses to them as they
steamed away. No wonder Nita Terriss was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
frivolous and flirtatious with such an example,
said society, and its frowns grew blacker when
the White Sisters, the Fairy Sisters&mdash;the &#8220;Sylphites,&#8221;
came in view. But frowns and fulminations
both fell harmless from the armor of
Mrs. Frank&#8217;s gay <i>insouçiance</i>. Nita winced at
first, but soon rallied and bore the slights of
the permanent and semi-permanent residents
as laughingly as did her more experienced sister.
Nita, it was explained, was only just out
of school, and Mrs. Frank was giving her this
summer at the Point as a great treat before
taking her to the far West, where the elder sister
must soon go to join her husband. Everybody
knew Frank Garrison. He had long been
stationed at the Academy, and was a man universally
liked and respected&mdash;even very highly
regarded. All of a sudden the news came back
to the Point a few months after his return to his
regiment that he was actually engaged to
&#8220;Witchie&#8221; Terriss. Hot on the heels of the
rumor came the wedding cards&mdash;Lieutenant-Colonel
and Mrs. Terriss requested the honour
of your presence at the marriage of their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
daughter Margaret to Lieutenant Francis Key
Garrison, &mdash;th U. S. Cavalry, at the Post
Chapel, Fort Riley, Kansas, November &mdash;, 1894&mdash;all
in Tiffany&#8217;s best style, as were the cards
which accompanied the invitation. &#8220;What a
good thing for old Bill Terriss!&#8221; said everybody
who knew that his impecuniosity was due
to the exactions and extravagancies of his wife
and &#8220;Witchie.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;And what a bad thing for
Frank Garrison!&#8221; was the echo. His intimates
knew that he had &#8220;put by&#8221; through economy
and self-denial about two thousand dollars, the
extent of his fortune outside of his pay. &#8220;She&#8217;ll
make ducks and drakes of it in the six weeks&#8217;
honeymoon,&#8221; was the confident prophecy, and
she probably did, for, despite the fact that he
had so recently rejoined the regiment, &#8220;Witchie&#8221;
insisted on a midwinter run to New Orleans,
Savannah and Washington, and bore her
lord, but not her master, over the course in
triumph. To a student of human nature&mdash;and
frailty&mdash;that union of a faded and somewhat
shopworn maid of twenty-seven to an ardent
and vigorous young soldier many moons her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
junior was easy to account for. One after another
Witchie Terriss had had desperate affairs
with half a dozen fellows, older or younger, in
the army and was known to have been engaged to
five different men at different times, and believed
to have been engaged to two different men at
one time. Asked as to this by one of her
chums she was reported to have replied: &#8220;Do
you know, I believe it true; I had totally forgotten
about Ned Colston before Mr. Forman
had been at the post a week. Of course the
only thing to do was to break with both and
let them start fresh.&#8221; But this Mr. Colston,
whose head had been somewhat cleared by a
month of breezy, healthful scouting, accepted
only in part&mdash;that part which included the
break. Forman had the fresh start and a walk
over and held the trophy just two months, when
it dawned upon him that Margaret loved dancing
far more than she did him&mdash;a clumsy performer,
and that she would dance night after
night, the lightest, daintiest creature in the hop
room, and never have a word or a look for him
who leaned in gloomy admiration against the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
wall and never took his eyes off her. He became
jealous, moody, ugly-tempered and finally
had the good luck to get his <i>congé</i> as the result
of an attempt to assert himself and limit her
dances. She was blithe and radiant and fancy
free when Frank Garrison reached the post,
a wee bit hipped, it was whispered, because of the
failure of a somewhat half-hearted suit of his
in the far East, and the Fairy bounded into the
darkness of his life and fairly dazzled him.
Somebody had said Frank Garrison had
money.
</p>
<p>There is no need to tell of the disillusion
that gradually came. Frank found his debts
mounting up and his cares increasing. She
was all sympathy and regret when he mentioned
it, but&mdash;there were certain comforts, luxuries
and things she had always been accustomed
to, and couldn&#8217;t live without. Surely
he would not have her apply to papa. No, but&mdash;could
she not manage with a little less? He
was willing to give up his cigars (indeed, he
had long since done so) and to make his uniforms
last a year longer&mdash;he who was in his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
day the most carefully dressed man at the
Point. Well&mdash;she thought perhaps he ought
to do that&mdash;besides&mdash;men&#8217;s fashions changed
but slowly, whereas women&#8217;s&mdash;&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d
rather be dead than out of style, Frank!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And so it went.
</p>
<p>But if she did not love her husband there was
one being in whom her frivolous heart was
really bound up&mdash;Nita&mdash;her &#8220;baby sister,&#8221; as
she called her, and when Terriss, the colonel,
went the way of all flesh, preceded only a few
months by the wife of his bosom, the few thousands
in life insurance he had managed to
maintain went to the two daughters. Not one
penny was ever laid out in payment of the
debts of either the father or husband. Nita
was sent to an extravagant finishing school in
Gotham, and along in May of the young girl&#8217;s
graduating year, blithe little Mrs. Garrison
arrived, fresh from the far West, and after a
few weeks of sightseeing and shopping the sisters
appeared at the Point, even half-mourning
by this time discarded. Thirteen years&#8217; difference
was there in the ages of the Fairy Sisters,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
and not a soul save those who knew them in
former days on the frontier would have suspected
it. Mrs. Frank in evening dress didn&#8217;t
look over twenty.
</p>
<p>One lovely evening early in August, just
about the time that Cadet Captain Latrobe
began to show well to the front in the run for
the prize, the two sisters had gone to their room
at the hotel to dress for the hop. It was their
custom to disappear from public gaze about six
o&#8217;clock and when they came floating down the
stairs in filmy, diaphanous clouds of white, the
halls were well filled with impatient cavaliers
in the natty cadet uniform, and with women
&#8220;waiting to see.&#8221; Then the sisters would go
into the dining room and have some light refreshment,
with a glass of iced tea&mdash;and no
matter how torrid the heat or how flushed and
dragged other women might look, they were
inviting pictures of all that was ever fresh, cool
and fragrant. The two fluffy blonde heads
would be huddled close together a minute as
they studied the bill of fare, and virtuous matrons
at other tables, fanning vigorously, would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
sniff and say: &#8220;All for effect. They know that
supper bill by heart. It never changes.&#8221; All
the same, at the bottom of this public display
of sisterly devotion and harmony and in spite
of occasional tiffs and differences, there was
genuine affection on both sides, for as a child
Nita had adored Margaret, and there could be
no doubting the elder&#8217;s love for the child.
Some regimental observers said that every bit
of heart that eldest Terriss girl had was
wrapped up in the little one. Neither girl,
even after Margaret&#8217;s marriage, would listen
to a word in disparagement of the other, but in
the sanctity of the sisterly retreat on the third
floor of the old hotel there occurred sometimes
spirited verbal tilts that were quite distinctly
audible to passers-by in the corridor, provided
they cared to listen, which some of them did.
On this especial August evening Mrs. Frank
was in an admonitory frame of mind. They
had known Mr. Latrobe barely three weeks,
and yet as Mrs. Frank was sauntering around
a turn in Flirtation Walk, leaning on the arm
of the cadet adjutant, there in the pathway
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
right ahead stood Nita, a lovely little picture
with downcast eyes, and &#8220;Pat&#8221; Latrobe bending
over her with love and passion glowing in
his handsome face, pleading eagerly, clinging
fervently to both her tiny, white-gloved hands.
Mrs. Garrison saw it all in the flash of a second,
the adjutant not at all, for with merry
laughter she repeated some words he had just
spoken as though they were about the wittiest,
funniest things in the world, and looked frankly
up into his eyes as though he were the best and
brightest man she had met in years&mdash;so his
eyes were riveted, and the tableau had time to
dissolve. All the same that sight gave Mrs.
Garrison rather more than a bad quarter of an
hour. She was infinitely worried. Not because
Pat Latrobe had fallen desperately in
love with her charming little sister&mdash;that was
his lookout&mdash;but what&mdash;oh, what might not
happen if the charming little sister were to fall
in love with that handsome soldier boy. At all
hazards, even if she had to whisk her away to-morrow,
that had to be stopped, and this very
evening when they went to their room Margaret
spoke.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nita, if it were only for Mr. Latrobe I
should not care a snap of my finger, but it&#8217;s
you&mdash;<i>you</i>! I thought you had more sense. I
thought you <i>fully</i> understood that you couldn&#8217;t
afford to lose yourself a moment, and yet if
ever a girl <i>looked</i> like yielding you did this
very afternoon. For my sake, for your own
sake, Nita, don&#8217;t let it go any further&mdash;<i>don&#8217;t</i>
fall in love&mdash;here&mdash;whatever you do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The younger sister stood at the dressing table
at the moment, her face averted. The Mary
Powell was just rounding the Point, and the
mellow, melodious notes of her bell were still
echoing through the Highlands. Nita was
gazing out on the gorgeous effect of sunset light
and shadow on the eastern cliffs and crags
across the Hudson, a flush as vivid mantling
her cheeks, her lip quivering. She was making
valiant efforts to control herself before replying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>not</i> in love with him,&#8221; she finally said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not&mdash;yet. Surely I hope not, but
it looked awfully like it was coming&mdash;and Nita,
you simply mustn&#8217;t. You&#8217;ve got to marry
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
money if I have to stand guard over you and
see you do it&mdash;and you know you can this minute&mdash;if
you&#8217;ll only listen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The younger girl wheeled sharply, her eyes
flashing. &#8220;Peggy, you promised me I shouldn&#8217;t
hear that hateful thing again&mdash;at least not
until we left here&mdash;and you&#8217;ve broken your
word&mdash;twice. You&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because I must. I can&#8217;t see you drifting&mdash;the
way I did when, with your youth and&mdash;advantages
you can pick and choose. Colonel
Frost has mines and money all over the
West, and he was your shadow at the seashore,
and all broken up&mdash;he told me&mdash;so when we
came here. Paddy Latrobe is a beautiful boy
without a penny&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His uncle&mdash;&#8221; began Nita feebly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;His uncle had a sister to support besides
Paddy&#8217;s mother. His pay as brigadier in the
regular service is only fifty-five hundred. He
<i>can&#8217;t</i> have saved much of anything in the past,
and he may last a dozen years yet&mdash;or more.
Even if he does leave everything then to Latrobe,
what&#8217;ll you do meantime? Don&#8217;t be a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
fool, Nita, because I was. I <i>had</i> to be. It was
that or nothing, and father was getting tired.
<i>You</i> heard how he talked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The younger sister was still at the dressing-table
diligently brushing her shining, curly
tresses. She had regained her composure and
was taking occasional furtive peeps at Mrs.
Frank, now seated at the foot of the bed, busy
with a buttonhook and the adjustment of a pair
of very dainty boots of white kid, whose buttons
gleamed like pearls. The mates to them, half
a size smaller, peeped from the tray of Nita&#8217;s
new trunk.
</p>
<p>There came a footstep and a rap at the door.
&#8220;See what it is, Nita, there&#8217;s a love&mdash;I don&#8217;t
want to hop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a card&mdash;a new arrival at the hotel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentleman said he&#8217;d wait in the parlor
&#8217;m,&#8221; said the bellboy, and vanished. Nita
glanced at the card and instant trouble stood
in her paling face. Silently Mrs. Garrison
held out her hand, took the card, and one
quick look. The buttonhook dropped from her
relaxed fingers. The card read:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gouverneur Prime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a second or two the sisters gazed at each
other in silence.
</p>
<p>At last the elder spoke: &#8220;In heaven&#8217;s name,
what brings that absurd boy back here? I
thought him safe in Europe.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p>One of the most charming writers of our day
and generation has declared that &#8220;the truest
blessing a girl can have&#8221; is &#8220;the ingenuous devotion
of a young boy&#8217;s heart.&#8221; Nine mothers
in ten will probably take issue with the gifted
author on that point, and though no longer a
young girl in years whatever she might be in
looks, Margaret Garrison would gladly have
sent the waiting gentlemen to the right about,
for, though he was only twenty, &#8220;Gov&#8221; Prime,
as a junior at Columbia, had been ingenuously
devoted to the little lady from the very first
evening he saw her. A boy of frank, impulsive
nature was &#8220;Gov&#8221;&mdash;a boy still in spite of
the budding mustache, the twenty summers
and the barely passed &#8220;exam&#8221; that wound up
the junior year and entitled him to sit with the
seniors when the great university opened its
doors in October. Studies he hated, but tennis,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
polo, cricket, riding and dancing were things
he loved and excelled in. Much of his boyhood
had been spent at one of those healthy, hearty
English schools where all that would cultivate
physical and mental manhood was assiduously
practiced, and all that would militate against
them was as rigorously &#8220;tabooed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the coming of his twentieth birthday that
summer his father had handed him his check
for five thousand dollars&mdash;the paternal expression
of satisfaction that his boy had never
smoked pipe, cigar or cigarette&mdash;and the same
week &#8220;Gov&#8221; had carried off the blue ribbon
with the racquet, and the second prize with the
single sculls. It was during the &#8220;exams,&#8221; the
first week in June, when dropping in for five
o&#8217;clock tea on some girls whom he had known
for years, he was presented to this witching
little creature whose name he didn&#8217;t even catch.
&#8220;We met her away out at an army post in Wyoming
when papa took us to California last year,&#8221;
was whispered to him, &#8220;and they entertained
us so cordially, and of course we said if ever
you come to New York you must be sure to let
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
us know&mdash;and she did&mdash;but&mdash;&#8221; and there his
informant paused, dubious. Other callers
came in and it began to rain&mdash;a sudden, drenching
shower, and the little stranger from the far
West saw plainly enough that her hostesses,
though presenting their friends after our cheery
American fashion, were unable to show her further
attention, and the newly presented&mdash;almost
all women, said &#8220;so very pleased&#8221; but
failed to look it, or otherwise to manifest their
pleasure. She <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> go in the rain. The butler
had &#8217;phoned for a cab. She wouldn&#8217;t sit there
alone and neglected. She deliberately signaled
Mr. Prime. &#8220;The ladies are all busy,&#8221; she
said, with a charmingly appealing smile, &#8220;but
I know you can tell me. I have to dress for
dinner after I get home, and must be at One
Hundred and Tenth Street at 7:30. How long
will it take a carriage to drive me there? Oh,
is that your society pin? Why, are <i>you</i> still
in college? Why, I thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>That cab was twenty-five minutes coming,
and when it came Mr. Prime went with it and
her, whom he had not left an instant from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
moment of her question. Moreover, he discovered
she was nervous about taking that carriage
drive all alone away up to One Hundred and
Tenth Street, yet what other way could a girl
go in dinner dress. He left her at her door
with a reluctantly given permission to return
in an hour and escort her to the distant home
of her friends and entertainers. He drove to
the Waldorf and had a light dinner with a half
pint of Hock, devoured her with his eyes as
they drove rapidly northward, went to a Harlem
theater while she dined and forgot him, and
was at the carriage door when she came forth
to be driven home. Seven hours or less &#8220;had
done the business,&#8221; so far as Gouverneur Prime
was concerned.
</p>
<p>It was the boy&#8217;s first wild infatuation&mdash;as
mad, unreasoning, absurd, yet intense as was
ever that of Arthur Pendennis for the lovely
Fotheringay. Margaret Garrison had never
seen or known the like of it. She had fascinated
others for a time, had kindled love, passion
and temporary devotion, but this&mdash;this was
worship, and it was something so sweet to her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
jaded senses, something so rich and spontaneous
that she gave herself up for a day or two to
the delight of studying it. Here was a glorious
young athlete whose eyes followed her every
move and gesture, who hung about her in utter
captivation, whose voice trembled and whose
eyes implored, yet whose strong, brown, shapely
hand never dared so much as touch hers, except
when she extended it in greeting. He was to
accompany his father and sister to Europe in a
week, so what harm was there: He would forget
all about it. He knew now she was married.
He was presented to Nita, but had hardly
a word and never a look for her when Margaret
was near. He was dumb and miserable all the
day they drove in the park and later dined at
Delmonico&#8217;s with Colonel Frost. He was sick,
even when mounted on his favorite English
thoroughbred and scampering about the bridle
path for peeps at the drives, when she was at
the park again with that gray-haired reprobate,
that money shark, Cashton&mdash;a Wall Street
broker black-balled at every decent club in
New York. Why should she go with him?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
He had been most kind, she said, in the advice
and aid he had given her in the investment of
her little fortune. She told the lie with downcast
eyes and cheeks that burned, for most of
that little fortune was already frittered away,
and Cashton&#8217;s reports seemed to require many
personal visits that had set tongues wagging at
the hotel, so much frequented of the Army,
where she had taken a room until Nita should
have been graduated and they could go to the
seashore. She had promised to be at home to
her boy adorer that very evening and to go
with him to Daly&#8217;s, and he had secured the
seats four days ahead. Poor &#8220;Gov&#8221; had
trotted swiftly home from the park, striving to
comfort himself over his bath and irreproachable
evening clothes, that <i>there</i>, with her by his
side, the wild jealousy of the day would vanish.
Sharply on time he had sent up his card and
listened, incredulous, to the reply: &#8220;Mrs. Garrison
has not yet returned.&#8221; He would wait,
he said, and did wait, biting his nails, treading
the floor, fuming in doubt and despair until
nearly ten, when a carriage dashed up to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
ladies&#8217; entrance and that vile Cashton handed
her out, escorted her in and vanished. She
came hurrying to her boy lover with both little
hands outstretched, with a face deeply flushed
and words of pleading and distress rushing from
her lips. &#8220;Indeed I could not help it, Gov,&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;I told him of my engagement and
said we must not go so far, but away at the
north end something happened, I don&#8217;t know
what, a wheel was bent and the harness
wrenched by too short a turn on a stone post at
a corner. Something had to be repaired. They
said it wouldn&#8217;t take ten minutes, and he led
me out and up to the piazza of that big hotel&mdash;you
know, we saw it the day I drove with
you&mdash;&#8221; (&#8220;He was a blackguard to take you
there!&#8221; burst in Prime, the blood boiling in his
veins.) &#8220;Then we waited and waited and he
went to hurry them, and then he came back
and said they had found more serious damages&mdash;that
it would take an hour, and meantime
dinner had been ordered and was served. He
had telephoned to you and the butler had answered
all right.&#8221; &#8220;He&#8217;s a double-dyed liar!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
raved &#8220;Gov,&#8221; furiously. &#8220;And so what
could I do, Gov? The dinner was delicious,
but I couldn&#8217;t eat a mouthful.&#8221; (This time it
wasn&#8217;t Cashton who lied). &#8220;I was worrying
about you, and&mdash;and&mdash;about myself, too, Gov.
I had set my heart on going with you. It
was to be almost our last evening. Oh, if you
only didn&#8217;t have to sail Saturday, and could
be here next week, you dear boy, you should
have no cause for complaint! Won&#8217;t you try
to forgive me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And, actually, tears stood in her eyes, as
again she held out both hands. They were the
only people in the parlor, and in an instant,
with quick, sudden, irresistible action he had
clasped and drawn her to his breast, and though
she hid her face and struggled, passionate
kisses were printed on her disheveled hair. It
was the first time he had dared.
</p>
<p>And then he did not sail Saturday. Prime
Senior was held by most important business.
They gave up the Saturday Cunarder and
took the midweek White Star, and those four
additional days riveted poor &#8220;Gov&#8217;s&#8221; chains
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
and left her well-nigh breathless with excitement.
The strain had been intense. It was all
she could do to make the boy try to behave in a
rational way in the presence of others. When
alone with her he raved. A fearful load was
lifted from her spare little shoulders when the
Teutonic sailed. Even Nita had worried and
had seen her sister&#8217;s worry. Then no sooner
did &#8220;Gov&#8221; reach Europe than he began writing
impassioned letters by every steamer, but that
wasn&#8217;t so bad. She had several masculine correspondents,
some of whom wrote as often as
Frank, but none of whom, to do her justice, got
letters as often as he did, which, however, was
saying little, for she hated writing. &#8220;Gov&#8221;
was to have stayed abroad three months, piloting
the pater and sister about the scenes so
familiar to him, but they saw how nervous and
unhappy he was. They knew he was writing
constantly to some one. Mildred had long
since divined that there was a girl at the bottom
of it all, and longed and strove to find out
who she was. Through the last of June and
all through July he resolutely stood to his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
promise and did his best to be loving and
brotherly to a loving and devoted sister and
dutiful to a most indulgent father. But he
grew white and worn and haggard, he who had
been such a picture of rugged health, and, in
her utter innocence and ignorance as to the being
on whom her brother had lavished the
wealth of his love, Mildred began to ask herself
should she not urge her father to let &#8220;Gov&#8221;
return to America. At last, one sweet July
evening, late in the month, the brother and
sister were wandering along the lovely shore of
Lucerne. He had been unusually fitful, restless
and moody all day. No letter had reached
him in over a fortnight, and he was miserably
unhappy. They stopped at a grassy bank that
ran down to the rippling water&#8217;s edge, and she
seated herself on a stone ledge, while in reckless
abandonment he threw himself full length
on the dewy grass. Instantly the last doubt
vanished. Bending over him, her soft hand
caressing his hair, she whispered: &#8220;Gov,
dear boy, is it so very hard? Would you like
to go to her at once?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>And the boy buried his face in her lap, twined
his arms about her slender waist, and almost
groaned aloud as he answered. &#8220;For pity&#8217;s
sake help me if you can, Mildred, I&#8217;m almost
mad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Early in August the swiftest steamer of the
line was splitting the Atlantic surges and driving
hard for home, with &#8220;Gov&#8221; cursing her for
a canal boat. The day after he reached New
York he had traced and followed the White
Sisters to West Point, and Margaret Garrison
stared in mingled delight, triumph and dismay
at the card in her hand. Delight that she could
show these exclusive Pointers that the heir to
one of the oldest and best names in Gotham&#8217;s
Four Hundred was a slave to her beck and call.
Dismay to think of the scene that might occur
through his jealousy when he saw the devoted
attentions she received from so many men&mdash;officers,
civilians and cadets. Old Cashton
came up now as regularly as Saturday night
came around&mdash;and there were others. Margaret
Garrison was more talked about than any
woman in Orange County, yet, who could report
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
anything of her beyond that she was a universal
favorite, and danced, walked, possibly
flirted with a dozen different cavaliers every
day of her life? There were some few among
her accusers, demure and most proper&mdash;even
prudish&mdash;women, of whom, were the truth to be
told, so little could not be said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gov&#8221; Prime took the only kind of room to be
had in the house, so full was it&mdash;a little seven
by ten box on the office floor. He would have
slept in the coal bin rather than leave her. He
saw her go off to the hop looking radiant,
glancing back over her shoulder and smiling
sweetly at him. He rushed to his trunk,
dragged out his evening clothes, and stood at
the wall looking on until the last note of the
last dance&mdash;he a noted German leader in the
younger set and the best dancer of his years in
Gotham. Not so much as a single spin had
he, and he longed to show those tight-waisted,
button-bestrewed fellows in gray and white how
little they really knew about dancing well as
many of them appeared on the floor. His reward
was tendered as the hop broke up. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
came gliding to him with such witchery in her
upraised face. &#8220;Now, sir, it is your turn. I
couldn&#8217;t give you a dance, for my card was
made out days ago, but Mr. Latrobe was glad
enough to get rid of taking me home. He is
daft about Nita, and of course she <i>can&#8217;t</i> let him
take her to more than one hop a week. Mr.
Stanton is her escort to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she placed her little hand on his arm,
and drew herself to his side, and when he would
have followed the others, going straight across
the broad plain to the lights at the hotel, turned
him to the left. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take you all
the way round, sir,&#8221; she said joyously.
&#8220;Then we can be by ourselves at least ten minutes
longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And so began the second period of Gouverneur
Prime&#8217;s thralldom. A young civilian at
the Point has few opportunities at any time,
but when the lady of his love is a belle in the
corps, he would much better take a long ocean
voyage than be where he could hear and see, and
live in daily torment. One comfort came to
him when he could not be with Mrs. Garrison
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
(who naïvely explained that &#8220;Gov&#8221; was such a
dear boy and they were such stanch friends,
real comrades, you know). He had early made
the acquaintance of Pat Latrobe, and there was
a bond of sympathy between them which was
none the less strong because, on Prime&#8217;s side,
it could neither be admitted nor alluded to&mdash;that
they were desperately in love with the sisters,
and it was not long before it began to
dawn on Prime that pretty little Nita was
playing a double game&mdash;that even while assuring
her guardian sister that she had only a
mild interest in Latrobe, she was really losing
or had lost her heart to him, and in every way
in her power was striving to conceal the fact
from Margaret, and yet meet her lover at hours
when she thought it possible to do so without
discovery. As the friendship strengthened between
himself and Latrobe they began using
him as Cupid&#8217;s postman, and many little notes
and some big ones found their way to and from
the Fourth Division of cadet barracks. Mrs.
Frank was only moderately kind to her civilian
adorer then, granting him only one dance at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
each hop, and going much with other men, but
that dance was worth seeing. Prime&#8217;s was the
only black &#8220;claw-hammer&#8221; in the room, and
therefore conspicuous, and cadets&mdash;who know a
good thing when they see it&mdash;and many a pretty
girl partner, would draw aside to watch the perfection
of their step and the exquisite ease with
which they seemed to float through space, circling
and reversing and winding among the
other dancers, he ever alert, watchful, quick as a
cat and lithe and strong as a panther&mdash;she all
yielding lissome airy grace. That dance was
&#8220;Gov&#8221; Prime&#8217;s reward, and almost only reward
for hours of impatient waiting. Other
women, charming and pretty and better women,
would gladly have been his partners. Some
two or three whom he met at the hotel even intimated
as much. But not until Lady Garrison
told him he must&mdash;to protect her from
scandal&mdash;did he ask another to dance. At last
came the end of the summer&#8217;s encampment,
the return of the corps to barracks and studies,
one blissful week in which he was enabled to
spend several uninterrupted hours each day at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
her side, and then a cataclysm. A letter intended
only for Nita&#8217;s hands fell into those of
her sister. It was bulky. It was from Latrobe.
She hesitated only a moment, then,
with determination in her eyes, opened and
read&mdash;all. Two days after Nita was whisked
away to New York, and within another week,
leaving two most disconsolate swains on the
Hudson, the sisters, one of them bathed in
tears, went spinning away to the West, where
Frank Garrison was on duty at department
headquarters. Prime was permitted to write
once a fortnight (he sent a volume), and Latrobe
forbidden, but already the poor boy owned
a thick packet of precious missives, all breathing
fond love and promising utter constancy
though she had to wait for him for years. For
a month Nita would hardly speak to her sister,
but in October there were lovely drives, picnics
and gayeties of all kinds. There were attractive
young officers and assiduous old ones, and
among these latter was Frost, with his handsome
gray mustache and distinguished bearing,
and that air of conscious success and possession
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
which some men know so well how to assume
even when their chances are slimmer than my
lady&#8217;s hand. The sisterly breach was healed
before that beautiful month was over. Frost
dined at the Garrison&#8217;s four times a week and
drove Miss Nita behind his handsome bays
every day or two. In November he asked a
question. In December there was an announcement
that called forth a score of congratulations
around headquarters, and in January the wedding
cards went all over the Union&mdash;some to
West Point&mdash;but to Latrobe, who had been looking
ill and anxious for six weeks, said his classmates,
and falling off fearfully in his studies,
said his professors, only a brief note inclosing
his letters and begging for hers. At reveille
next morning there was no captain to receive
the report of roll call from the first sergeant of
Company &#8220;B.&#8221; &#8220;Where&#8217;s Latrobe?&#8221; sleepily
asked the officer of the day of the cadet first
lieutenant. &#8220;I don&#8217; know,&#8221; was the answer,
and to the amaze of Latrobe&#8217;s roommate, who
had gone to bed and to sleep right after taps
the night before, they found evidence that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
&#8220;Pat&#8221; had left the post. He had not even
made down his bedding. His cadet uniforms
were all there, but a suit of civilian clothes,
usually in a snug package up the chimney, that
had been used several times &#8220;running it&#8221; to
the hotel after taps in August, was now, like
its owner, missing. After three days&#8217; waiting
and fruitless search, the superintendent wired
Latrobe&#8217;s uncle and best friend, old General
Drayton, and that was the last seen or heard of
&#8220;Pat.&#8221; In the spring and ahead of time his
class was graduated without him, for the war
with Spain was on. In the spring an irate and
long-tried father was upbraiding another only
son for persistent failures at college. &#8220;Gov
Prime will get the sack, not the sheepskin,&#8221;
prophesied his fellows. And then somehow,
somewhere the father heard it was a married
woman with whom his boy was so deeply
in love, and there were bitter, bitter words
on both sides&mdash;so bitter that when at last he
flung himself out of his father&#8217;s study Gov
Prime went straight to Mildred&#8217;s room, silently
kissed her and walked out of the house. This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
was in April. The next heard of him he had
enlisted for the war and was gone to San
Francisco with his regiment with the prospect
of service in the Philippines ahead of him, but
that was full four months after his disappearance.
Thither, late in July the father followed,
bringing Mildred with him and&mdash;the
reader knows the rest.

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p>One of Colonel Frost&#8217;s consuming ambitions
was to be the head of his department, with the
rank of brigadier-general, but he had strong
rivals, and knew it. Wealth he had in abundance.
It was rank and power that he craved.
Four men&mdash;all with better war records and
more experience&mdash;stood between him and that
coveted star, and two of the four were popular
and beloved men. Frost was cold, selfish, intensely
self-willed, indomitably persevering,
and though &#8220;close-fisted,&#8221; to the scale of a
Scotch landlord as a rule, he would loose his
purse strings and pay well for services he considered
essential. When Frost had a consuming
desire he let no money consideration stand
in the way, and for Nita Terriss he stood ready
to spend a small fortune. Everybody knew
Mrs. Frank Garrison could never dress and
adorn herself as she did on poor Frank Garrison&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
pay, and when she appeared with a dazzling
necklace and a superb new gown at the
garrison ball not long after Frost and his
shrinking bride left for their honeymoon, people
looked at her and then at each other. Nita
Terris was sold to &#8220;Jack&#8221; Frost was the verdict,
and her shrewd elder sister was the dealer.
Mrs. Frank knew what people were thinking
and saying just as well as though they had
said it to her, yet smiled sweetness and bliss on
every side. Frankly she looked up into the
faces of her sisters in arms: &#8220;I know you like
my necklace. Isn&#8217;t it <i>lovely</i>? Colonel Frost&#8217;s
wedding present, you know. He said I
shouldn&#8217;t give Nita away without some recompense,
and this is it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But that could have been only a part of it,
said the garrison. An honorarium in solid
cash, it was believed, was far the greater portion
of the consideration which the elder sister
accepted for having successfully borne Nita
away from the dangers and fascinations of the
Point&mdash;having guarded her, drooping and
languid, against the advances of good-looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
soldier lads at headquarters, and finally having,
by dint of hours of argument, persuasion and
skill, delivered her into the arms of the elderly
but well-preserved groom. All he demanded to
know was that she was fancy free&mdash;that there
was no previous attachment, and on this point
Mrs. Frank had solemnly averred there was
none. The child had had a foolish fancy for a
cadet beau, but it amounted to absolutely nothing.
There had been no vows, no pledge, no
promise of any kind, and she was actually free
as air. So Frost was satisfied.
</p>
<p>They made an odd-looking pair. Frost was
&#8220;pony built&#8221; but sturdy, and Nita seemed like
a fairy&mdash;indeed as unsubstantial as a wisp of
vapor, as she came down the aisle on his arm.
They were so far to the south on this honeymoon
trip as almost to feel the shock and concussion
when the Maine was blown to a mass
of wreckage. They were in Washington when
Congress determined on full satisfaction from
Spain, and Colonel Frost was told his leave
was cut short&mdash;that he must return to his station
at once. Going first to the Arlington and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
hurriedly entering the room, he almost stumbled
over the body of his wife, lying close to the
door in a swoon from which it took some time
and the efforts of the house physician and the
maids to restore her. Questioned later as to
the cause she wept hysterically and wrung her
hands. She didn&#8217;t know. She had gone to
the door to answer a knock, and got dizzy and
remembered nothing more. What became of
the knocker? She didn&#8217;t know. Frost inquired
at the office. A bellboy was found who said
he had taken up a card in an envelope given
him by a young feller who &#8220;seemed kind o&#8217;
sick. Mrs. Frost took it and flopped,&#8221; and a
chambermaid ran in to her, and then hurried
for the doctor. &#8220;What became of the letter or
note or card?&#8221; asked Frost, with suspicion and
jealousy in his heart. Two women, mistress
and maid, and the bellboy swore they didn&#8217;t
know, but the maid did know. With the quick
intuition of her sex and class she had seen that
there was or had been a young lover, and sympathy
for Nita and a dislike for Frost, who
gave no tips, prompted her to hide it until she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
could slip it safely into Nita&#8217;s hand; Nita who
read, shuddered, tore it into minute scraps, and
wept more, face downward on the bed. They
had reached their winter station before the
cable flashed the stirring tidings of Dewey&#8217;s
great victory in Manila Bay, and within half a
week came telegraphic orders for Colonel Frost
to proceed at once to San Francisco, there to
await instructions. The first expedition was
organizing when he arrived, his pallid little
wife by his side, and there were his instructions
to proceed to Manila as chief of his department&mdash;an
independent position, and yet it was a
horrid blow. But there was no recourse. Nita
begged that she might stay with her sister. She
could not bear the idea of going. Frost knew
that no women could accompany the expedition,
and, shipping his chest and desks by the
transport, he had secured passage for himself
and wife to Hongkong on one of the splendid
steamers of the English line from Vancouver,
and so informed her. It dashed Nita&#8217;s last
hope. They were occupying fine rooms at the
Palace Hotel. The city was thronged with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
officers and rapidly arriving troops. Other
army women, eager to accompany their husbands,
were railing at the fate that separated
them, and Nita had been forced to conceal the
joy with which she heard their lamentations.
But she had yet to learn how exacting Frost
could be. It had never occurred to her that he
could obtain permission to go except by transport.
It had not seemed possible that he would
take her with him. &#8220;You should have known,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;that even if I had had to go by transport,
you would have gone by the Empress of
India. It is only sixty hours from Manila to
Hongkong, and I could have joined you soon
after your arrival. As it is I shall see you
safely established there&mdash;I have letters to certain
prominent English people&mdash;then shall go
over to join the fleet when it arrives in Manila
Bay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That night she wrote long and desperately to
Margaret. &#8220;He swore he would follow me
wherever we went until I granted him the interview.
You know how he dogged me in Washington,
followed me to Denver, and any moment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
he may address me here. F. will not let
me return to you. He insists on my going to
Hongkong, where he can occasionally join me.
But Rollin holds those letters over me like a
whip, and declares that he will give them into
Frost&#8217;s hands unless I see him whenever he
presents himself. You made me swear to
Frost I never cared a straw for my darling that
was. O God, how I loved him! and if these
letters ever reach the man to whom you have
sold me, he would treat me as he would a dog,
even if he doesn&#8217;t kill me. Meg&mdash;Meg&mdash;you
must help me for I live in terror.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And that she lived in terror was true, some
women were quick to see. Never would she go
anywhere, even along the corridor, alone. If
the colonel could not come to luncheon she was
served in their rooms. If she had to go calling
or shopping it was in a carriage and always
with some army woman whom she could persuade
to go with her.
</p>
<p>One day, just before their intended departure,
she drove out paying parting calls. It was
quite late when the carriage drew up at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
Market Street entrance, the nearest to their elevator.
The door boy sprang across the sidewalk
to open the carriage, and as she stepped
wearily out, a tall young man, erect and slender,
dressed in a dark traveling suit, fairly
confronted her, raised his derby, and said:
&#8220;You can give me ten minutes now, Mrs.
Frost. Be good enough to take my arm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bowing her head she strove to dodge by, but
it was useless. Again he confronted her.
Piteously she looked up into his pale, stern
face and clasped her hands. &#8220;Oh, Rollin,&#8221;
she cried, &#8220;give me my letters. I dare not&mdash;see
you. Have mercy&mdash;&#8221; and down again
she went in a senseless heap upon the stone.
Colonel and Mrs. Frost did not sail with the
Empress of India. Brain fever set in and for
three weeks the patient never left the hotel.
Frost made his wife&#8217;s dangerous illness the
basis of an application to be relieved from the
Manila detail, but, knowing well it would be
late summer before the troops could be assembled
there in sufficient force to occupy the city,
and that his clerks and books had gone by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
transport with the second expedition in June,
the War Department compromised on a permission
to delay. By the time the fourth expedition
was ready to start there was no further
excuse; moreover, the doctors declared the sea
voyage was just what Mrs. Frost needed, and
again their stateroom was engaged by the
Empress line, and, though weak and languid,
Mrs. Frost was able to appear in the dining-room.
Meanwhile a vast amount of work was
saddled on the department to which Frost was
attached, and daily he was called upon to aid
the local officials or be in consultation with the
commanding general. This would have left
Mrs. Frost to the ministrations of her nurse
alone, but for the loving kindness of army
women in the hotel. They hovered about her
room, taking turns in spending the afternoon
with her, or the evening, for it was speedily
apparent that she had a nervous dread of being
left by herself, &#8220;or even with her husband,&#8221;
said the most observing. Already it had been
whispered that despite his assiduous care and
devotion during her illness, something serious
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
was amiss. Everybody had heard of the adventure
which had preceded her alarming illness.
Everybody knew that she had been accosted
and confronted by a strange young
man, at sight of whom she had pleaded piteously
a minute and then fainted dead away.
By this time, too, there were or had been nearly
a dozen of the graduating class in town&mdash;classmates
of Rollin Latrobe&mdash;their much-loved
&#8220;Pat&#8221;&mdash;and speedily the story was told of his
devotion to her when she was Nita Terriss, of
their correspondence, of their engagement to be
married on his graduation, which in strict confidence
he had imparted to his roommate, who
kept it inviolate until after her sudden union
with Colonel Frost and poor &#8220;Pat&#8217;s&#8221; equally
sudden disappearance. Everybody, Frost included,
knew that the young man who had accosted
her must be Latrobe, and Frost by this
time knew that it must have been he who
caused her shock at the Arlington. He raged
in his jealous heart. He employed detectives
to find the fellow, swearing he would have him
arrested. He became morose and gloomy, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
all the arts by which Mrs. Garrison persuaded
him that Nita looked up to him with admiration
and reverence that would speedily develop
into wifely love were now proved to be machinations.
He knew that Nita feared him,
shrank from him and was very far from loving
him, and he believed that despite her denials
and fears and protestations she loved young
Latrobe. He wrote angrily, reproachfully to
Margaret, who, now that her fish was hooked,
did not greatly exert herself to soothe or reassure
him. That he could ever use violence to
one so sweet and fragile as Nita she would not
believe for an instant. Then the nurse, still
retained, heard bitter words from the colonel as
one morning she came to the door with Mrs.
Frost&#8217;s breakfast, and while she paused, uncertain
about entering at such a time, he rushed
angrily forth and nearly collided with her.
Mrs. Frost was in tears when the nurse finally
entered, and the breakfast was left untouched.
</p>
<p>Late that afternoon, just after the various
trunks and boxes of the Frosts that were to go
by the transport were packed and ready, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
Mrs. Frost, looking stronger at last, though
still fragile, almost ethereal, was returning
from a drive with one of her friends, the attention
of the two ladies was drawn to a crowd
gathering rapidly on the sidewalk not far from
the Baldwin Hotel. There was no shouting,
no commotion, nothing but the idle curiosity of
men and boys, for a young soldier, a handsome,
slender, dark-eyed, dark-complexioned fellow of
twenty-one or two, had been arrested by a
patrol and there they stood, the sergeant and
his two soldiers fully armed and equipped, the
hapless captive with his arms half filled with
bundles, and over the heads of the little throng
the ladies could see that he was pleading earnestly
with his captors, and that the sergeant,
though looking sympathetic and far from unkind,
was shaking his head. Mrs. Frost, listless
and a little fatigued, had witnessed too
many such scenes in former days of garrison
life to take any interest in the proceeding.
&#8220;How stupid these people are!&#8221; she irritably
exclaimed. &#8220;Running like mad and blocking
the streets to see a soldier arrested for absence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
from camp without a pass. Shan&#8217;t we drive
on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;just one moment, please, Mrs. Frost.
He has such a nice face&mdash;a gentleman&#8217;s face,
and he seems so troubled. Do look at it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Languidly and with something very like a
pout, Mrs. Frost turned her face again toward
the sidewalk, but by this time the sergeant had
linked an arm in that of the young soldier and
had led him a pace or two away, so that his
back was now toward the carriage. He was
still pleading, and the crowd had begun to back
him up, and was expostulating, too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Awe, take him where he says, sergeant, and
let him prove it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be hard on him, man. If he&#8217;s taking
care of a sick friend give &#8217;m a chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the sergeant tried to explain matters.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t help myself, gentlemen,&#8221; said he;
&#8220;orders are orders, and mine are to find this
recruit and fetch him back to camp. He&#8217;s two
days over time now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish I knew what it meant!&#8221; anxiously
exclaimed Mrs. Frost&#8217;s companion.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he needs help.&#8221; Then with sudden
joy in her eyes&mdash;&#8220;Oh, good! There goes Colonel
Crosby. He&#8217;ll see what&#8217;s amiss,&#8221; and as
she spoke a tall man in the fatigue uniform of
an officer of infantry shouldered his way
through the crowd, and reached the blue-coated
quartette in the center. Up went the hands to
the shouldered rifles in salute, and the young
soldier, the cause of all the gathering which
the police were now trying to disperse, whirled
quickly, and with something suspiciously like
tears in his fine dark eyes, was seen to be
eagerly speaking to the veteran officer. There
was a brief colloquy, and then the colonel said
something to the sergeant at which the crowd
set up a cheer. The sergeant looked pleased,
the young soldier most grateful, and away went
the four along the sidewalk, many of the
throng following.
</p>
<p>And then the colonel caught sight of the
ladies in the carriage, saw that one was signaling
eagerly, and heard his name called. Hastening
to their side, he raised his cap and smiled
a cordial greeting.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad you came, colonel, we are
so interested in that young soldier. Do tell us
what it all means. Oh! I beg your pardon,
Mrs. Frost, I surely thought you had met
Colonel Crosby&mdash;let me pre&mdash; Why, Nita!
What&#8217;s&mdash; Are you ill? Here, take my salts,
quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no&mdash;go on&mdash;I&mdash;I want to hear! Where
are they taking him?&#8221; faintly murmured Mrs.
Frost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to control yourself,&#8221; said her companion.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you in one moment.&#8221; Meantime
from without the carriage the colonel
continued, addressing Nita&#8217;s companion:
</p>
<p>&#8220;He tells a perfectly straight story. He says
he has an old friend who is here so desperately ill
and out of money that he got a doctor for him
and had been nursing him himself. Those
things he carried are medicines and wine that
the doctor bade him buy. All he asks is to
take them to his friend&#8217;s room and get a nurse,
then he is ready to go to camp and stand his
trial, so I told the sergeant I&#8217;d be responsible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you so much! Do see that the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
poor fellow isn&#8217;t punished. We&#8217;ll drive right
round. Perhaps we can do something. It is
Red Cross business, you know. <i>Good</i>-afternoon,
colonel. Please tell our driver to follow
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But, to her consternation, no sooner had they
started than she felt Nita&#8217;s trembling hand
grasping her wrist, and turning quickly saw
that she was in almost hysterical condition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor child, I had forgotten you were
so worn out. I&#8217;ll take you home at once&mdash;but
then we&#8217;ll miss them entirely. Oh, could you
bear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! No! No!&#8221; moaned Nita, wringing
her little hands. &#8220;Take me&mdash;anywhere. No!
Take me home&mdash;take me home! and promise me
not to&mdash;not to tell my husband what we saw.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p>For a man ordinarily absorbed in his own
command, Colonel Stanley Armstrong had become,
all on a sudden, deeply engrossed in that
of Colonel Canker. The Frosts had been gone a
week, via Vancouver&mdash;the expedition only about
sixteen hours&mdash;when he appeared at Gordon&#8217;s
tent and frankly asked to be told all that tall
Southerner knew of the young soldier Morton,
now gone from camp for the third, and, as
Armstrong believed, the last time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that young fella&#8217;s a bawn gentleman,&#8221;
drawled Gordon, as he offered the
colonel a chair and cigar. &#8220;He was behavin&#8217;
tip top, steady as you please until about a
month ago. He&#8217;s only been with us since the
first of May&mdash;came with a big batch of recruits&mdash;a
regular athlete, you know. Then after he&#8217;d
drilled awhile I nailed him for headquarters
clerk. I never knew him to be off an hour until
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
about four weeks ago. The men say another
young fella came out here one night, had a talk
with Morton, and they went out together. He
got regular permission. Nobody has set eyes
on his friend out here since that time, but Morton
got three passes to town in ten days, and
Squeers happened to want him, and gave orders
<i>he</i> should have to be consulted hereafter. &#8217;Bout
a fortnight since, by Jove, Morton lit out suddenly
and was gone forty-eight hours, and was
brought back by a patrol, perfectly straight,
and he said he had to go on account of a friend
who had been taken very ill and was a stranger
here. Squeers let him off with a warning, and
inside of three days he begged for a twenty-four-hour
pass, and Squeers wouldn&#8217;t give it.
He went without it, by George! It was just
about the time the Prime family arrived, looking
up the boy they heard was in your regiment.
This time there was big trouble. The
patrol sent for him went directly to the lodgings
of his sick friend, and there they found him and
he laid out two of our best men for forcing a
way into the room. They told me your carriage
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
nearly ran over him the day of the review.
Then came that dam fool charge about his being
mixed up in this robbery. Then his escape
from under Billy Gray&#8217;s nose, by George, and
that&#8217;s the last of him. Canker sent a party in
to look him up at the usual place, and both
birds had flown, both, by George! The sick
man was well enough to be driven off in a carriage,
and there&#8217;s nothing further to tell as
yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had known about him earlier&mdash;before
the Primes came,&#8221; said Armstrong
thoughtfully, knocking the ashes off his cigar.
&#8220;Of course you divine my theory?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That Morton&#8217;s the missing son and heir?
Of course. Now that I&#8217;ve seen Miss Prime the
family resemblance is strong. But if he wanted
to soldier, what&#8217;s to prevent. Those tents
yawnduh are full of youngsters better educated
than I am,&#8221; and Gordon arose, tangling a
long, lean leg in the nearest campstool, which
he promptly kicked through the doorway into
the sailing fog outside. It was barely eleven
o&#8217;clock, but already the raw, wet wind was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
whistling in over the barren, sandy slopes and
dunes, and the moisture dripped in big drops
from the sloped rifles of the men marching
sturdily in from drill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yawnduh comes the Prime carriage now,
by George,&#8221; continued the adjutant, as he
limped to the entrance. &#8220;Ole man seems all
broke up, don&#8217;t he?&#8221; Armstrong had promptly
risen and came striding to his comrade&#8217;s side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;He had
hoped much from this visit. The boy was just
under twenty-one when he enlisted, and, as his
father&#8217;s consent was lacking, a discharge could
have been ordered. It may have been fear of
that that drove the youngster off. Where is
the carriage&mdash;and your glass?&#8221; continued the
colonel, looking about until he found a binocular.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Comin&#8217; right down the road back of the
officers&#8217; tents. Reckon it&#8217;s another visit of condolence
to Gray. You know I shouldn&#8217;t
wonduh if this arrest of his proved a blessin&#8217;
in disguise for that lucky boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>No reply coming to this observation, Gordon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
glanced over his shoulder. Armstrong was replacing
the glasses. Again the adjutant
hazarded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I was sayin&#8217; this arrest may be, after
all, the biggest kind of blessing in disguise for
that lucky Billy. <i>Yes</i>, by Jove! They&#8217;re
comin&#8217; to his tent. <i>That&#8217;s</i> a splendid girl, ole
man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss&mdash;Prime, you mean?&#8221; calmly queried
Armstrong, striking match after match in the
effort to light a fresh cigar, his face averted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Prime I <i>don&#8217;t</i> mean,&#8221; answered Gordon,
glancing curiously at the senior officer.
&#8220;Not but that she&#8217;s a most charming young
lady and all that,&#8221; he hurriedly interpolated,
Southern chivalry asserting itself. Then with
a twitch about the lip: &#8220;By the way, ole
man, those cigars light better from the other
end. Take a fresh one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Armstrong quickly withdrew the ill-used
weed from between his strong, white teeth,
gave it one glance, and a toss into the waste-basket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve smoked enough. But how can
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
they see him? How about that sentry over
Gray&#8217;s tent?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! Chief made him take it off directly
he heard of it,&#8221; grinned Gordon. &#8220;Moses!
But didn&#8217;t Squeers blaspheme!&#8221; And the adjutant
threw his head back and laughed joyously
over the retrospect. &#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s that
curly pate of Billy&#8217;s at the tent door now.
Reckon he was expectin&#8217; &#8217;em. There they are,
ole Prime, too. Don&#8217;t be in a hurry, colonel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They had known each other years, these two,
and it had been &#8220;Armstrong&#8221; and &#8220;Gordon&#8221;
when they addressed each other, or &#8220;ole man&#8221;
when Gordon lapsed into the semi-affectionate.
To the adjutant&#8217;s Southern sense of military
propriety &#8220;ole man&#8221; was still possible. &#8220;Armstrong&#8221;
would be a soldierly solecism.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am to see the General before noon,&#8221; said
Armstrong gravely, &#8220;and it&#8217;s time I started. If
you should hear of your runaway let me know.
If you shouldn&#8217;t, keep our views to yourself.
There&#8217;s no use in rousing false hopes.&#8221; With
that Armstrong turned up the collar of his overcoat
and lunged out into the mist.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>Gordon watched him as he strode away, the
orderly following at the conventional distance.
The shortest way to general headquarters was
up the row of company officers&#8217; tents in front
of the still incarcerated Billy; the longest was
around back of the mess tent and kitchen.
Armstrong took the latter.
</p>
<p>That escape of prisoners was still the talk of
camp. Men had come by battalions to see the
tunnel, observing which Canker promptly
ordered it closed up. Opinion was universal
that Canker should have released the officers
and men he had placed under arrest at once,
but he didn&#8217;t. In his bottled wrath he hung
on to them until the brigade commander took a
hand and ordered it. Canker grumblingly
obeyed so far as the sergeant and sentries were
concerned, but entered stout protest as to Gray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I still hold that officer as having knowledge
of the scheme and aiding and abetting. I can
prove that he telephoned for that carriage,&#8221; he
said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At least there&#8217;s nothing to warrant the posting
of that sentry at Mr. Gray&#8217;s tent, Colonel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
Canker,&#8221; said the brigadier, with some asperity.
&#8220;Order him off at once. That&#8217;s all for
to-day, sir,&#8221; and the man with the starred
shoulders &#8220;held over&#8221; him with the silver
leaves. The latter could only obey&mdash;and objurgate.
</p>
<p>But Canker&#8217;s knuckles came in for another
rasping within the hour. The brigadier being
done with him, the division commander&#8217;s compliments
came over per orderly, and would the
colonel please step to the General&#8217;s tent.
Canker was fuming to get to town. He was
possessed with insane desire to follow up that
boarding house clue. He believed the landlady
could be bullied into telling where her
boarder was taken, and what manner of man
(or woman) he was. But down he had to go,
three blocks of camp, to where the tents of division
headquarters were pitched, and there
sat the veteran commander, suave and placid
as ever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, colonel, touching that matter of the
robbery of your commissary stores. Suspicion
points very strongly to your Sergeant Foley.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
Do you think it wise to have no sentry over
him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;General,&#8221; said Canker, &#8220;I&#8217;ve known
that man fifteen years&mdash;in fact, I got him
ordered to duty here,&#8221; and the colonel bristled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;pardon me, colonel, but you heard
the evidence against him last night, or at least
heard of it. Don&#8217;t you consider that conclusive?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Canker cleared his throat and considered as
suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard the allegation sir, but&mdash;he made so
clear an explanation to <i>me</i>, at least&mdash;and besides,
General&#8221;&mdash;a bright idea occurring to him&mdash;&#8220;you
know that as commissary sergeant he
is not under my command&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, colonel,&#8221; interrupted the General,
waxing impatient. &#8220;The storehouse adjoins
your camp. Your sentries guard it. Captain
Hanford, the commissary, says he called on
you last night to notify you that he had placed
the sergeant under arrest, but considered the
case so grave that he asked that a sentry be
placed over him, and it wasn&#8217;t done.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I dislike very much to inflict such indignity
on deserving soldiers, General,&#8221; said Canker,
stumbling into a self-made trap. &#8220;Until their
guilt is established they are innocent under the
law.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently you apply a different rule in
case of officers,&#8221; calmly responded the General,
&#8220;<i>vide</i> Mr. Gray. No further words are necessary.
Oblige me by having that sentry posted
at once. Good-morning, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But to Canker&#8217;s dismay the officer of the
guard made prompt report. The sentry was
sent, but the sergeant&#8217;s tent was empty. The
colonel&#8217;s pet had flown. This meant more
trouble for the colonel.
</p>
<p>Meantime Stanley Armstrong had hied him
to General Drayton&#8217;s headquarters. The office
tents were well filled with clerks, orderlies,
aides and other officers who had come in on
business, but this meeting was by appointment,
and after brief delay the camp commander excused
himself to those present and ushered
Armstrong into his own private tent, the scene
of the merry festivities the evening of Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
Garrison&#8217;s unexpected arrival. There the General
turned quickly on his visitor with the low-toned
question:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;what have you found?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough to give me strong reason for believing
that Morton, so-called, is young Prime, and
that your nephew is with him, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old soldier&#8217;s sad eyes lighted with sudden
hope. Yet, as he passed his hand wearily over
his forehead, the look of doubt and uncertainty
slowly returned. &#8220;It accounts for the letters
reaching me here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but&mdash;I&#8217;ve known
that boy from babyhood, Armstrong, and a
more intense nature I have never heard of.
What he starts in to do he will carry out if it
kills him.&#8221; And Drayton looked drearily
about the tent as though in search of something,
he didn&#8217;t quite know what. Then he
settled back slowly into his favorite old chair.
&#8220;Do sit down, Armstrong. I want to speak
with you a moment.&#8221; Yet it was the colonel
who was the first to break the silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask if you have had time to look at
any of the letters, sir?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look as though I had time to do <i>any</i>-thing?&#8221;
said the chief, dropping his hands and
uplifting a lined and haggard face, yet so refined.
&#8220;Anything but work, work, morn, noon
and night. The mass of detail one has to meet
here is something appalling. It weighs on
me like a nightmare, Armstrong. No, I was
worn out the night after the package reached
me. When next I sought it the letters were
gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long was that, General?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the weary hands, with their long,
tapering fingers, came up to the old soldier&#8217;s
brow. He pondered a moment. &#8220;It must have
been the next afternoon, I think, but I can&#8217;t be
sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you had left them&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the inside pocket of that old overcoat of
mine, hanging there on the rear tent pole,&#8221;
was the answer, as the General turned half-round
in his chair and glanced wistfully, self-reproachfully
thither.
</p>
<p>Armstrong arose, and going to the back of
the tent, made close examination. The canvas
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
home of the chief was what is known as the
hospital tent, but instead of being pitched with
the ordinary ridgepole and uprights, a substantial
wooden frame and floor had first been
built and over this the stout canvas was
stretched, stanch and taut as the head of a
drum. It was all intact and sound. Whoever
filched that packet made way with it through
the front, and that, as Armstrong well knew,
was kept tightly laced, as a rule, from the time
the General left it in the morning until his return.
It was never unlaced except in his presence
or by his order. Then the deft hands of
the orderlies on duty would do the trick in a
twinkling. Knowing all this, the colonel
queried further:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You went in town, as I remember, late that
evening and called on the Primes and other people
at the Palace. I think I saw you in the
supper room. There was much merriment at
your table. Mrs. Garrison seemed to be the
life of the party. Now, you left your overcoat
with the boy at the cloak stand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Armstrong, that&#8217;s the odd part of it. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
only used the cape that evening. The coat was
hanging at its usual place when I returned
late, with a mass of new orders and papers.
No! no! But here, I must get back to the
office, and what I wished you to see was that
poor boy&#8217;s letter. What can you hope with a
nature like that to deal with?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Armstrong took the missive held out to him,
and slowly read it, the General studying his
face the while. The letter bore no clue as to
the whereabouts of the writer. It read:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>March</span> 1st, &#8217;98.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is six weeks since I repaid all your loving
kindness, brought shame and sorrow to you
and ruin to myself, by deserting from West
Point when my commission was but a few
short months away. In an hour of intense
misery, caused by a girl who had won my very
soul, and whose words and letters made me believe
she would become my wife the month of
my graduation, and who, as I now believe, was
then engaged to the man she married in January,
I threw myself away. My one thought
was to find her, and God knows what beyond.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can never be undone. My career is ended,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
and I can never look you in the face again.
At first I thought I should show the letters,
one by one, to the man she married, and ask
him what he thought of his wife, but that is
too low. I hold them because I have a mad
longing to see her again and heap reproaches
upon her, but, if I fail and should I feel at any
time that my end is near, I&#8217;m going to send
them to you to read&mdash;to see how I was lured,
and then, if you can, to pity and forgive.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Rollin.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Armstrong&#8217;s firm lips twitched under his
mustache. The General, with moist eyes, had
risen from his chair and mechanically held
forth his hand. &#8220;Poor lad!&#8221; sighed Armstrong.
&#8220;Of course&mdash;you know who the girl
was?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course,&#8221; and Drayton shrugged his
shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll have to go,&#8221; and led on to the
misty light without.
</p>
<p>Over across the way were the headquarters
tents of a big brigade, hopefully awaiting
orders for Manila. To their left, separated by
a narrow space, so crowded were the camps,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
were the quarters of the officers of the &mdash;teenth
Infantry, and even through the veil of mist
both soldiers could plainly see along the line.
Coming toward the gate was Mr. Prime, escorted
by the major. Just behind them followed
Mildred and the attentive Schuyler.
But where was Miss Lawrence? Armstrong
had already seen. Lingering, she stood at
Billy&#8217;s tent front, her ear inclined to his protruding
pate. He was saying something that
took time, and she showed no inclination to
hurry him. Miss Prime looked back, then she
and Schuyler exchanged significant smiles and
glances. There was rather a lingering handclasp
before Amy started. Even then she
looked back at the boy and smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; said the General, as he gazed, &#8220;that
youngster wouldn&#8217;t swap places with any subaltern
in camp, even if he <i>is</i> under charges.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no answer from the strong soldier
standing observant at his elbow. But when
the chief would have moved Armstrong detained
him. &#8220;One more question, General. In
case you were away and wanted something you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
had left in this tent, you would send an aide&mdash;or
orderly, or&mdash;would an order signed by one
of your staff be sufficient?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m, well&mdash;yes, I suppose it would,&#8221; said
the General.

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p>Opinion was divided at Camp Merritt as to
whether Billy Gray should or should not stand
trial. Confident as were his friends of his innocence
of all complicity in Morton&#8217;s escape,
there remained the fact that he had telephoned
for a carriage, that a carriage had come and
that a carriage with four men, apparently soldiers,
had driven rapidly townward along Point
Lobos Avenue. It was seen by half a dozen
policemen as it shot under electric light or
gas lamp. Then there was the bundle inside
his rolled overcoat that Gray had personally
handed Morton when a prisoner. Everybody
agreed he should have sent it by orderly&mdash;everybody,
that is, except some scores of young
soldiers in the ranks who could see no harm in
it having been done that way, especially two
&#8220;Delta Sigs&#8221; in the &mdash;teenth. Then there were
the long conferences in the dark. What did
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
they mean? All things considered the older
and wiser heads saw that, as the lieutenant
could or would make no satisfactory explanation
of these to his colonel, he must to a court&mdash;or
take the consequences.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made a mess of the thing and an
ass of yourself, Billy,&#8221; was Gordon&#8217;s comprehensive
if not consolatory summary of the matter,
&#8220;and as Canker has been rapped for one
thing or another by camp, division and brigade
commanders, one <i>after</i> another, he feels that
he&#8217;s got to prove that he isn&#8217;t the only fool in
the business. You&#8217;d better employ good counsel
and prepare for a fight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t afford it,&#8221; said Billy briefly, &#8220;and
I&#8217;m blowed if I&#8217;ll ask my dear old dad to come
to the rescue. He&#8217;s had to cough up (shame
on your slang, Billy) far too much already. I
tell you, Gordon, I&#8217;m so fixed that I can&#8217;t explain
these things unless I&#8217;m actually brought
to trial. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;well&mdash;you have no secret
societies at the Point as we do at college, so
you can&#8217;t fathom it. I&#8217;m no more afraid of
standing trial than I am of Squeers&mdash;and be
d&mdash;&mdash;d to him!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lawd, youngster&mdash;you&mdash;you aren&#8217;t
quite such an ass as to suppose a court is going
to regard any schoolboy obligation as paramount
to that which your oath of office demands.
Look hyuh, Billy, your head&#8217;s just
addled! <i>I</i> can&#8217;t work on you, but somebody
must!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Gordon went away very low in his
mind. He liked that boy. He loved a keen,
alert, snappy soldier on drill, and Billy had no
superior in the battalion when it came to handling
squad or company. The adjutant plainly
saw the peril of his position, and further consultation
with his brother-officers confirmed
him in his fears. Schuyler, the brigade commissary,
being much with the &mdash;teenth&mdash;messing
with them, in fact, when he was not dancing
attendance on Miss Prime&mdash;heard all this camp
talk and told her. Thus it happened that the
very next day when he drove with the cousins
(Mr. Prime being the while in conference with
the detectives still scouring the city for the
young deserter, who the father now felt confident
was his missing boy), Miss Lawrence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
looked the captain full in the face with her
clear, searching eyes and plumped at him the
point-blank question:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Schuyler, do Mr. Gray&#8217;s brother-officers
really consider him in danger of dismissal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Lawrence, I grieve to say that not one
has any other opinion now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There could be no doubt of it. Amy Lawrence
turned very pale and her beautiful eyes filled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a shame!&#8221; she said, after a moment&#8217;s
struggle to conquer the trembling of her lips.
&#8220;Has&mdash;is there no one&mdash;influential enough&mdash;or
with brains enough&#8221; (this with returning color)
&#8220;to take up his case and clear him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were whirling through the beautiful
drive of the Golden Gate Park, passing company
after company at drill. Even as Amy
spoke Schuyler lifted his cap and Miss Prime
bowed and smiled. A group of regimental
officers, four in number, stood, apparently
supervising the work, and as Miss Lawrence
quickly turned to see who they might be, her
eyes met those of Colonel Armstrong. Five
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
minutes later, the carriage returning drew up
as though by some order from its occupants, at
that very spot. Armstrong and his adjutant
were still there and promptly joined them.
</p>
<p>Long weeks afterward that morning lived in
Stanley Armstrong&#8217;s memory. It was one of
those rare August days when the wind blew
from the southeast, beat back the drenching
Pacific fogs, and let the warm sun pour upon
the brilliant verdure of that wonderful park.
Earth and air, distant sea and dazzling sky,
all seemed glorifying their Creator. Bright-hued
birds flashed through the foliage and
thrilled the ear with their caroling. The plash
of fountain fell softly on the breeze, mingled
with the rustling of the luxuriant growth of
leaf and flower close at hand. It was not
chance that brought the stalwart soldier instantly
to Amy&#8217;s side. Her gaze was upon him
before the carriage stopped, and irresistibly
drew him. The man of mature years, the hero
of sharp combats and stirring campaigns with a
fierce and savage foe, the commander of hundreds
of eager and gallant men, obeyed without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
thought of demur the unspoken summons of a
girl yet in her teens. There was a new light in
her clear and beautiful eyes, a flush upon her
soft and rounded cheek, a little flutter, possibly,
in her kind and loyal heart. Heaven knows
his beat high with an emotion he could not subdue,
though his bearing was grave and courteous
as ever, but about that sweet and flushing
face there shone the halo of a woman&#8217;s brave
determination, and no sooner had be reached the
carriage side than, bending toward him, she
spoke. Mildred Prime could not repress a little
gasp of amaze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Armstrong, will you kindly open
the carriage door? I want to talk with you a
moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Without a word he wrenched the handle and
threw wide the door. Light as a bird she
sprang to the ground, her fingers just touching
the extended hand. Side by side they strolled
away across the sunlit lawn, he so strong,
virile, erect, she so lissome and graceful. Full
of her purpose, yet fearful that with delay
might come timidity, she looked up in his
face:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Armstrong, I have heard only to-day
that Mr. Gray is in really serious danger.
Will you tell me&mdash;the truth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just what Armstrong expected it might be
hard to say. The light that had leaped to his
eyes faded slowly and his face lost something
of the flush of robust health. There was a brief
pause before he spoke as though he wished
time to weigh his words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear it is true,&#8221; he gravely said. Then
in a moment: &#8220;Miss Lawrence, will you not
take my arm?&#8221; And he felt her hand tremble
as she placed it there. It was a moment before
she began again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They tell me he should have counsel, but
will not heed. I have not seen him to-day.
There is no one in his battalion, it seems, whom
he really looks up to. He is headstrong and
self-confident. Do you think he should&mdash;that
he needs one?&#8221; And anxiously the brave eyes
sought the strong, soldierly face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would seem so, Miss Lawrence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She drew a long breath. She seemed to cling
a little closer to his arm. Then&mdash;straight came
the next question:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Armstrong, will you do me a great
favor? Will you be his counsel?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was looking directly to the front as she
spoke. Something told him what was coming,
yet he could not answer all at once. What did
it mean, after all, but just what he had been
thinking for a week, that the girl&#8217;s fresh young
heart had gone out to this merry, handsome,
soldierly lad, whom he, too, had often marked
with keen appreciation when in command of his
big company at drill. What possible thought
of hers could he, &#8220;more than twice her years,&#8221;
have ever hoped to win. She had come to him
in her sore trouble&mdash;and her lover&#8217;s&mdash;as she
would have gone to her father had he been a
soldier schooled in such affairs. Armstrong
pulled himself together with quick, stern self-command.
</p>
<p>Looking down, he saw that her eyes were filling,
her lips paling, and a rush of tenderness
overcame him as he simply and gently
answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and there is no time to be lost.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>All these last days, it will be remembered,
Mrs. Frank Garrison with pretty &#8220;Cherry
Ripe&#8221; had found shelter at the Presidio. The
Palace was no place for a poor soldier&#8217;s wife,
and there was no longer a grateful nabob as a
possible source of income. It is doubtful indeed
whether that mine could be further tapped, for
the effusive brother-in-law of the winter gone
by had found disillusion in more ways than
one. Garrison, busy day and night with his
staff duties, had plainly to tell his capricious
wife that she had come without his knowledge
or consent, and that he could not think of meeting
the expense of even a two weeks&#8217; stay in
town. He could not account for her coming at
all. He had left her with his own people where
at least she would be in comfort while he took
the field. He desired that she should return
thither at once. She determined to remain and
gayly tapped his cheek and bade him have no
concern. She could readily find quarters, and
so she did. The regular garrison of the Presidio
was long since afield, but the families of many
of its officers still remained there, while the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
houses of two or three, completely furnished so
far as army furnishings go, were there in charge
of the post quartermaster. From being the
temporary guests of some old friends, Mrs.
Frank and her pretty companion suddenly
opened housekeeping in one of these vacated
homes, and all her witchery was called into
play to make it the most popular resort of the
younger element at the post. Money she might
lack, but no woman could eclipse her in the
dazzle of her dainty toilets. The Presidio was
practically at her feet before she had been established
forty-eight hours. Other peoples&#8217; vehicles
trundled her over to camp whenever she would
drive. Other peoples&#8217; horses stood saddled at
her door when she would ride. Other peoples&#8217;
servants flew to do her bidding. Women might
whisper and frown, but for the present, at least,
she had the men at her beck and call. Morn,
noon and night she was on the go, the mornings
being given over, as a rule, to a gallop over the
breezy heights where the brigade or regimental
drills were going on, the afternoons to calls,
wherein it is ever more blessed to give than to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
receive&mdash;and the evenings to hops at the assembly
room, or to entertaining&mdash;charmingly entertaining
the little swarm of officers with occasional
angels of her own sex, sure to drop in
and spend an hour. Cherry played and sang
and &#8220;made eyes&#8221; at the boys. Mrs. Frank was
winsome and genial and joyous to everybody,
and when Garrison himself arrived from camp,
generally late in the evening, looking worn and
jaded from long hours at the desk, she had ever a
comforting supper and smiling, playful welcome
for her lord, making much of him before the
assembled company, to the end that more than
one callow sub was heard to say that there
would be some sense in marrying, by George,
if a fellow could pick up a wife like Mrs.
Frank. All the same the post soon learned that
the supposedly blest aide-de-camp breakfasted
<i>solus</i> on what he could forage for himself before
he mounted and rode over to his long day&#8217;s
labor at Camp Merritt. Another thing was
speedily apparent, the <i>entente cordial</i> between
her radiant self and the Primes was at an end,
if indeed it ever existed. <i>She</i>, to be sure, was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
sunshine itself when they chanced to meet at
camp. The clouds were on the faces of the
father and daughter, while Miss Lawrence
maintained a serene neutrality.
</p>
<p>They were lingering in &#8217;Frisco, still hopefully,
were the Primes. The detectives on duty
at the landing stage the evening Stewart&#8217;s regiment
embarked swore that no one answering
the description of either of the two young men
had slipped aboard. Those in the employ of
the sad old man were persistent in the statement
that they had clues&mdash;were on the scent,
etc. He was a sheep worth the shearing, and
so, while Mr. Prime spent many hours in consultation
with certain of these so-called sleuth-hounds,
the young ladies took their daily drive
through the park, generally picking up the
smiling Schuyler somewhere along the way,
and rarely omitting a call, with creature comforts
in the way of baskets of fruit, upon the
happy Billy, whose limits were no longer restricted
to his tent, as during the first week of
his arrest, but whose court was ordered to sit
in judgment on him the first of the coming
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
week. Already it began to be whispered that
Armstrong had a mine to spring in behalf of
the defense, but he was so reserved that no one,
even Gordon, sought to question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Armstrong is a trump!&#8221; said Billy to Miss
Lawrence, one fair morning. &#8220;He&#8217;ll knock
those charges silly&mdash;though I dare say I could
have wormed through all right; only, you see,
I couldn&#8217;t get out to find people to give evidence
for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you&mdash;see him often?&#8221; she asked, somewhat
vaguely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Armstrong!&#8221; exclaimed Billy, in open-eyed
amaze. &#8220;Why, he&#8217;s here with me every day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But never,&#8221; thought Miss Lawrence, &#8220;in
the morning&mdash;when we are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The eventful Monday was duly ushered in,
but not the court. That case never came to
trial. Like the crack of a whip an order
snapped in by wire on the Thursday previous&mdash;three
regiments, the &mdash;teenth regulars and
the &#8220;Primeval Dudes,&#8221; Armstrong&#8217;s splendid
regiment among them&mdash;to prepare for sea voyage
forthwith. More than that, General Drayton
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
and staff were directed to proceed to
Manila at once. Two-thirds of the members of
the court were from these regiments. A new
detail would be necessary. The General sent
for Armstrong.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we try that case here and now?&#8221; he
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Armstrong, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll send
for Canker that <i>he</i> may be satisfied.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Canker came and listened. It was admitted
that Gray had had a long talk with the
prisoner, took him his overcoat, newspapers,
etc., but, in extenuation, they were members of
the same college society and their social standing
was, outside the army, on the same plane.
Gray deserved reprimand and caution&mdash;nothing
more. As to the carriage, he had nothing to do
with the one that drove to camp that night. A
man in the uniform of a commissary sergeant
giving the name of Foley (how Canker winced)
had ordered it at the stable and taught the
driver &#8220;Killarney.&#8221; Gray had &#8217;phoned for a
carriage for himself, hoping to get the officer-of-the-day&#8217;s
permission to be absent two hours
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
to tell his story in person to the General, who
was dining with the department commander.
He never got the permission, and the carriage
went to the wrong camp. Lieutenant W. F.
Gray was released from arrest and returned to
duty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never be able to thank you enough,&#8221;
said he, sentimentally, to Miss Lawrence, at the
Palace that evening. They were strolling up
and down the corridor, waiting, as was Schuyler,
for Mildred to come down for the theater.
Gray&#8217;s curly head was inclined toward the
dark locks of his fair partner. His eyes were
fastened on her faintly flushing face. They
made a very pretty picture, said people who
looked on knowingly, and so thought the officer
in the uniform of a colonel of infantry, who,
while talking calmly to Mr. Prime full thirty
yards away, watched them with eyes that were
full of sadness. How could <i>he</i> see at that distance
that her eyes, clear and radiant, were seldom
uplifted to the ardent gaze of her escort,
and were at the moment looking straight at him?
How could he hear at that distance the prompt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
response, given with an inclination of the bonny
head to indicate her meaning?
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s where your thanks are due, Mr.
Gray.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Quite a gathering of army folk was at the
Palace that night. So many wives or sweethearts
were going home, so many soldiers
abroad, and Mrs. Frank Garrison, gay and
gracious, passed them time and again, leaning
on the arm of Captain McDonald, a new devotee,
while poor Cherry, with an enamored swain
from the Presidio, languished in a dim, secluded
corner. She had been recalled by parental
authority and was to start for Denver under
a matronly wing on the morrow. Mrs. Frank
had been bidden, and expected, to go at the
same time, but that authority was merely marital.
Up to this time not one army wife had
been permitted to accompany her husband on
any of the transports to Manila, though one
heroine managed to get carried away and to
share her liege lord&#8217;s stateroom as far as Honolulu.
The General and his staff, with a big
regiment of volunteers, were to sail on the morrow,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
the other regiments as fast as transports
could be coaled and made ready.
</p>
<p>Something in Mrs. Garrison&#8217;s gay, triumphant
manner prompted a sore-hearted woman,
suffering herself at the coming parting, to turn
and say: &#8220;Well, Mrs. Garrison, I suppose that
after your husband sails you&#8217;ll have to follow
the rest of us into grass-widowhood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One thing that made women hate Margaret
Garrison was that she &#8220;could never be taken
down,&#8221; and the answer came cuttingly, as it
was meant to go, even though a merry laugh
went with it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I! When the ship I want is ready, I
go with it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But as she turned triumphantly away, the
color suddenly left her cheek and there was an
instant&#8217;s falter. As though he had heard her
words, Stanley Armstrong too had suddenly
turned and stood looking sternly into her eyes.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p>Still another expedition was destined to
start for Manila, and keen was the rivalry
among the regiments held to daily drill at San
Francisco. The rumor was current in the
camps that the next review was to decide the
matter, and that the commands pronounced to
be foremost in discipline and efficiency would
be designated to embark. The transports that
had conveyed the earlier expeditions to the
Philippines began to reappear in the bay, and
coaling and refitting were hurried to the
utmost. The man most eager to get away was
Stanley Armstrong; and if merit were to decide
the matter it was conceded among the volunteers
that in point of style and equipment the
&#8220;Primeval Dudes&#8221; &#8220;held over&#8221; all competitors,
even though every competitor believed itself
more than a match for the Dudes if actual
campaigning and fighting were in contemplation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
Senators and members from the States
represented by the volunteers at San Francisco
led burdensome lives, for officers and men were
pulling every wire to secure the longed-for
orders for an immediate voyage to Manila,
when, all on a sudden, the hopes of all were
crushed. Spain had begged for peace. &#8220;No
more men can be sent to Manila,&#8221; said the
officials consulted, and Camp Merritt put on
mourning forthwith.
</p>
<p>But Armstrong had been studying the situation
and was not easily daunted. He was a
man whose opinion carried weight, and from
the very first he had maintained that while fifteen
or twenty thousand might be men enough
to hold Manila, fifty thousand might not be
enough to subdue at once the forces of Aguinaldo
in case they should turn upon the Americans,
which said he, placidly, they will most
certainly do before we are a year older.
</p>
<p>The Dudes, therefore, much to their disgust,
were kept steadily at work. Other regiments,
profiting by example, followed suit; but in
others still, a small proportion of their membership,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
believing as they said, that the &#8220;jig
was up,&#8221; took to lawless and unhallowed expression
of their disgust and became thereby a
nuisance to the neighborhood. San Franciscans,
who had wept copiously when others
sailed away, would have seen these patriots
sent into exile without shedding a tear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every man of this command will yet be
needed and yet be sent,&#8221; said Armstrong. So,
too, did the veteran division commander, and
the brigade took heart accordingly. The last
of the regulars, with the recruit detachments
for regiments already in the Philippines, had
been shipped to Honolulu, there to await orders,
and September seemed destined to go by without
a change for the better in the prospects of
the men still left in camp about the reservation.
The Primes, convinced at last that the boy they
sought was not to be found in California, had
gone to Santa Anita visiting their kindred, the
Lawrences; and Armstrong, buckling down to
hard and constant work, was striving to persuade
himself that he did not care that the
mornings no longer brought with them the carriage
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
and the fair face of that gentle girl; the
department commander himself had gone to
take a look at his new responsibilities in
Hawaii; little Mrs. Garrison still held court,
though with diminished retinue, at the
Presidio, when one day, just as October was
ushered in, there came a message from the adjutant-general
in town. Would Armstrong
drop in at the office at the first opportunity?
A matter of some importance had come up in
the general&#8217;s first letter from Honolulu,
one on which Armstrong&#8217;s opinion was desired;
and the colonel, hoping for tidings of a chance
to move even that far to the front, made immediate
opportunity and took the first car for
the Phelan Building. The adjutant-general
looked up from a littered desk as Armstrong
entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is good of you to come so promptly,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;I&#8217;m in a stew, to tell the truth, and I want
your advice.&#8221; Then he tapped his bell. &#8220;Excuse
me to any one who comes for the next ten
minutes,&#8221; said he, to the attendant who entered.
&#8220;I have business with Colonel Armstrong.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>No sooner did the orderly vanish than the
man of the desk whirled full on the man of the
saddle. &#8220;Armstrong,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you defended
Gray and proved him innocent. What else
has Canker against him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing that I know of&mdash;why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he&#8217;s got him in arrest again at
Honolulu, and the chief is worked up over
something. Look here&mdash;do you suppose&mdash;did
you ever hear about certain letters that were
stolen from General Drayton&#8217;s tent?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard&mdash;yes. Why?&#8221; And the look of
disappointment which had appeared in the
grave face of the colonel gave way to one of
alert interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just read that,&#8221; said the staff official, holding
forth a letter. &#8220;Begin there at &#8216;Later!&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Armstrong read, his forehead slowly
grooving into something very like a frown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Later. I may have to remain here several
days. Canker, with the &mdash;teenth, went ahead
before news of the protocol could stop him; but
he leaves here a number of sick&mdash;Lieutenant
Gray, charged with using threatening and insubordinate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
language to his commanding
officer, among them; and Gray is down with
brain fever. The doctors say he is too ill to be
disturbed, and his side of the story is hard to
get at, as the boy is too flighty to talk sense.
From Canker&#8217;s own admission I learned that
he accused Gray of having knowledge of the
whereabouts of that packet of letters stolen
from General Drayton&#8217;s tent, and the youngster&#8217;s
reply was furious. Canker <i>had</i> to place
him in arrest and prefer charges. When asked
if he were sure of his ground in making so serious
an accusation, he declared he had proof positive,
at least he would have the instant they
reached Manila, and his intention was to take
the boy along with him to be tried there by
court-martial, where &#8220;no meddling outsiders,&#8221;
as he said, could buy off witnesses. It was
plain that he considered himself out of my jurisdiction,
and that he resented my staff officer&#8217;s
questions. But Dr. Morrow had appealed to
me in behalf of Gray. Said that if compelled
to continue a prisoner aboard that transport
under Canker&#8217;s tyrannical rule Gray might be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
goaded into insanity. He was in a condition
bordering on brain fever when Morrow came to
see me, and in another day was raving. That
settled it. I ordered him taken off and placed
in hospital here, and Canker had to go without
him. But I wish you would see Armstrong
and tell him about Gray, so that I may know
the whole situation as soon as I return. Canker
evidently intended not to let us know his proofs.
He probably believes that he will find a more
credulous and complaisant listener in Drayton;
but his insinuations pointed to Gray as at least
an abettor in the theft, and he went so far as
to say that if Armstrong could be brought before
the court some very interesting testimony
could be dragged from him, and, finally, that
both Armstrong and Mrs.&mdash;well, the wife of a
staff officer who is already well on the way to
Manila&mdash;might be compelled to testify. I cannot
bring myself to repeat more that he said;
but he was in an ugly and almost defiant mood,
and I had to give him a dressing down. You
may say to Armstrong for me that I do not believe
one word of Canker&#8217;s calumny at his expense
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
or that of the lady in the case. But he
declared his intention of laying the whole matter
before General Drayton immediately on his arrival,
and it is best that Armstrong should be
prepared. As for the lady, Canker said she and
Armstrong were very close friends when they
were at Fort Stanhope ten years ago, though they
no longer meet as such.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that brings me to another matter. I
declined positively to allow two or three
ladies, wives of officers, to go on to Manila
with Canker&#8217;s command; and they said that
as I had promised Mrs. Garrison a passage
I had no right to refuse them. Pressed for
their authority, two very estimable women told
me that, at the Presidio two days before we
sailed, Mrs. Garrison openly boasted of having
my promise to send her on the very next steamer.
Now, who is really the fabricator? I told her
positively that, with my consent, she should
not go; and she laughed delightedly, and said
she only asked as a matter of form&mdash;the whole
thing had already been settled. Just see to it
that if any more transports start before my return
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
no woman is permitted aboard except, of
course, authorized nurses. Gray is a very sick
boy to-night, but you might wire his father,
saying nothing of the arrest, that the doctors
are confident of his recovery in course of time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Armstrong read these pages twice over before
he looked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did this letter come?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the Salvador yesterday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the next mail for Honolulu?&#8221; queried
Armstrong, rising from his chair and handing
back the folded letter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The next mail closed an hour ago, man.
The China sails at two. No other boat for a
week. Where are you going now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To camp for ten minutes, then to the
Presidio.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come over to the club and have a bite
first?&#8221; said the adjutant-general, rising and
wriggling out of his uniform coat as he did so.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t keep you half an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That half-hour may prove precious,&#8221; answered
Armstrong, already at the door. &#8220;Many
thanks all the same.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well. Hold on. What am I to say to the
General as to Gray and those letters?&#8221; asked
the staff officer, intent upon the subject uppermost
in his mind at the moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t say anything that will reach him
before he returns. You have just told me no
other boat would start for a week. By that
time he&#8217;ll be coming home.&#8221; And with that
Armstrong let himself out and strode to the
elevator, leaving his friend to cogitate on the
question over his luncheon. It was decidedly
that officer&#8217;s opinion that Armstrong knew
much more than he would tell.
</p>
<p>But Armstrong knew much less than he himself
believed. Hastening back to camp and ordering
his horse, he was soon speeding up the
slope to the wind-swept heights overlooking the
Golden Gate. The morning had opened fine
as silk, but by noon the sky was hidden in
clouds and the breath of the sea blew in salt
and strong. The whitecaps were leaping on
the crest of the surges driving in through the
straits and the surf bursting high on the jagged
rocks at the base of the cliffs. A little coast
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
steamer from Santa Barbara way came pitching
and plunging in from sea, and one or two venturesome
craft, heeling far to leeward, tore
through the billows and tossed far astern a
frothing wake. With manes and tails streaming
in the stiff gale, the troop horses of the
Fourth Cavalry were cropping at the scanty
herbage down the northward slope, and the
herd guard nearest the road lost his grip on his
drab campaign hat as he essayed a salute, and
galloped off on a stern chase down the long
ravine to the east, as the colonel trotted briskly
by. One keen glance over the bay beyond
rocky Alcatraz had told him the China was not
yet away from her pier. He might have to
send a dispatch by that swift steamer, and even
then it would be six days getting to Hawaii.
If the department commander should by that
time be on his homeward journey the information
would still be of interest to the general
commanding the new military district at &#8220;the
Cross Roads of the Pacific,&#8221; and of vast benefit,
possibly, to his late client, Mr. Gray. He
wondered what Canker&#8217;s grounds could be for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
saddling so foul a suspicion on the boy&#8217;s good
name. He wondered how long that poor lad
would have to struggle with this attack of fever
and remain, perhaps happily, unconscious of
this latest indignity. He wondered if Amy
Lawrence yet knew of that serious seizure, and,
if she did, what would be her sensations.
Down the winding, sloping road he urged his
way, Glencoe, his pet charger, marveling at
the unusual gait. The cape of the sentry&#8217;s
overcoat whirled over the sentry&#8217;s head and
swished his cap off as he presented arms to the
tall soldier spurring past the guardhouse. &#8220;I
envy no one who has to put to sea this day,&#8221;
said Armstrong to himself, as he turned to the
right and reined up in front of a little brown
cottage peeping out from a mass of vines and
roses, shivering in the wet wind. Half a dozen
strides took him across the narrow walk and up
the wooden steps. With sharp emphasis he
clanged the little gong bell screwed to the back
of the door and waited impatient for the servant&#8217;s
coming. There was no answer. He
rang again and still again, and no one came.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
A glance at the windows told that the white
lace curtains hung there draped as prettily as
ever. Fresh flowers stood on the window sill.
A shawl and a pillow, the latter indented as by
a human head, lay in the lounging chair on the
little porch. Another chair stood but a few
feet away. There was even a fan, though fans
in a &#8217;Frisco summer are less needed than furs;
but nowhere saw he other sign of the temporary
mistress of the house. He went round to a side
window and rapped. No answer. Then he
turned to the walk again, and, taking the reins,
bade the orderly inquire next door if Mrs. Garrison
could be found. Yes, was the answer;
she went driving to Golden Gate Park with
Mrs. Stockman an hour ago, and Mrs. Stockman
was to leave for Los Angeles that night.
Odd! If Mrs. Garrison drove to Golden Gate
Park the easiest and best way was that along
which he came, and he had met no carriage.
In fact, not since that night at the Palace had
he set eyes on Mrs. Garrison, or until the coming
of this sorrowful news about Gray had he cared
to. From all that he heard Mrs. Frank was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
enjoying herself at the Presidio. Cherry having
gone one way and her devotee another,
Mrs. Frank speedily summoned a chum of old
garrison days to come and keep house with her
for a while, and Mrs. Stockman, whose lord
had left her at the call to duty, and gone to
Manila with his men, right gladly accepted and
much enjoyed the fun and frolic that went on
night after night in Mrs. Frank&#8217;s cozy parlor,
or the mild flirtation, possibly, in the recesses
of Mrs. Frank&#8217;s embowered porch. The last
expedition had borne off almost all the &#8220;regular&#8221;
element at the post, but had not left it
poor, for, fast as camp grounds could be made
ready for them, vastly to the disgust of the
saloon keepers and street-car magnates who had
reaped rich harvest from Camp Merritt, regiment
after regiment, the volunteers came
marching over from the malodorous sand lots
and settled down in sheltered nooks about the
Presidio. So cavaliers in plenty were still to
be had, cavaliers whose wives and sweethearts,
as a rule, were far away; and Mrs. Frank loved
to console such as were so bereft. The chafing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
dish and Scotch and soda were in nightly request;
and even women who didn&#8217;t at all fancy
Mrs. Frank, and spoke despitefully of her
among themselves, were not slow to come in
&#8220;for just a minute,&#8221; as they said, as the evenings
wore on, and to stay and chat with various
visitors&mdash;it was so lonesome and poky over
home with the children asleep and nothing to
do. Women there were who never darkened
Mrs. Garrison&#8217;s door after the first formal calls;
but they were of those who deeply felt the
separation from all they held most dear, and
who, forbidden themselves, heard with envy
and even distress her gay assertion that she
would sail for Manila the moment the Queen
of the Fleet was ready. From what source&mdash;or
circumstance&mdash;did she derive her influence?
</p>
<p>But with the edict that no more troops should
be sent came comfort to the souls of these bereaved
ones. Transports would not go without
troops, and Mrs. Frank could not go without
transports, the journey was far too expensive.
They wished her no evil, of course; but, if they
were themselves forbidden how could they rejoice
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
that she should be permitted? They were
actually beginning to feel a bit charitable
toward her when the Queen of the Fleet herself
came in from Honolulu with the latest news.
The fifth expedition had been halted there and
put in camp. The hospital held several
officers. Billy Gray was down with brain
fever, and there had been a furious scene between
him and his peppery colonel before the
breakdown; and by that same steamer Mrs.
Garrison had got a letter that made her turn
white and tremble, as Mrs. Stockman saw and
told, and then shut herself up in her room an
entire day. Now, for nearly a fortnight, the
lovely guest had been daily hinting that she
really must go home, &#8220;dear Witchie&#8221; was surely
tired of her; and Witchie disclaimed and protested
and vowed she could not live without
her devoted friend. But then had come that
letter and with it a change of tone and tactics.
Witchie ceased to remonstrate or reprove Mrs.
Stockman, and the latter felt that she must go,
and Witchie consented without demur.
</p>
<p>In no pleasant mood Armstrong mounted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
and trotted for the east gate. The road was
lined with camps and volunteers at drill.
Vehicles were frequently moving to and fro;
but the sentry at the entrance had kept track of
them, and in response to question answered
promptly and positively Mrs. Garrison&#8217;s carriage
had not come that way. &#8220;But,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;the wagon with the lady&#8217;s baggage did. I
saw the name on the trunks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The colonel turned in saddle and coolly surveyed
him. &#8220;Do you mean Mrs. Stockman&#8217;s
name?&#8221; he asked in quiet tone. &#8220;How many
trunks were there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, some of them might have had Mrs.
Stockman&#8217;s name, sir; but the two or three that
I saw were marked M. G.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was unlooked-for news. To her next-door
neighbor Mrs. Garrison had said nothing
about going away with Mrs. Stockman, and
Armstrong had grave need to see her and to see
her at once. The train for Los Angeles did not
leave until evening. Possibly they were lunching
somewhere&mdash;spending the afternoon with
friends in town. He rode direct to headquarters.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
Some of the staff might be able to tell,
was his theory; and one of them justified it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I happen to meet Mrs. Garrison? Yes,
I just saw her aboard the China.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aboard the China!&#8221; exclaimed Armstrong,
with sudden thrill of excitement. &#8220;D&#8217;you
mean she is going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t ask her. They were hustling everybody
ashore, and I had only time to give
dispatches to Purser; but she was on the deck
with friends when I came away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>People wondered that day at the speed with
which the tall officer, followed by his orderly,
clattered away down Market Street. In less
than ten minutes Armstrong was at the crowded
pier and pushing through the throng to the
China&#8217;s stage. Too late! Already it was
swung aloft, the lines were cast loose, and the
huge black mass was just beginning to back
slowly from its moorings. The rail of the
promenade deck swarmed with faces, some
radiant, some tearful. Words of adieu, fluttering
kerchiefs, waving hands, tossing flowers
were there on every side. Two officers, Honolulu
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
bound, shouted Armstrong&#8217;s name, and a
cheery good-by; but he did not seem to hear.
A gentle voice, the voice of all others he most
longed to hear, repeated the name and strove to
call attention to his gesticulating comrades on
the upper deck; but he was deaf to both.
Eagerly, anxiously, incredulously he was
searching along that crowded rail, and all on a
sudden he saw her. Yes, there she stood, all
gayety, grace and animation, stylishly gowned
and fairly burdened with roses; and it was
right at him she was gazing, nodding, smiling,
all sweetness, all confiding, trusting joy; with
just a little of triumph, too, and a tinge of sentimental
sorrow in the parting. Apparently,
it was all for him; for her blue eyes never faltered
till they fixed his gaze, and then, kiss
after kiss she threw to him with the daintily
gloved little hand, and, leaning far down over
the rail, lowering it toward him as much as
possible, she finally tossed to him, standing
there stern and spellbound, a bunch of beautiful
roses she had torn from her corsage. It fell
almost at his feet, for in his astonishment and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
rising wrath he made no effort to catch it. A
man, stooping quickly, rescued and handed it
to him. Mechanically he said &#8220;Thank you,&#8221;
and took it, a thorn pricking deep into the flesh
as he did so; and still his eyes were fixed on
that fairy form now surely, swiftly gliding
away, and over him swept the consciousness of
utter defeat, of exasperation, of dismay, even as
he strove to fathom her motives in thus singling
him out for such conspicuous&mdash;even affectionate&mdash;demonstration.
Triumph and delight he
could have understood, but not, not this semblance
of confidential relations, not at least until
he felt his arm grasped by a cordial hand,
heard his name spoken by a friendly voice, and
Mr. Prime&#8217;s pleasant inquiry: &#8220;Have you no
greeting for other friends?&#8221; Then the hot
blood rushed to his face and showed even
through the bronze as, turning, his troubled
eyes met full the clear, placid gaze of Amy
Lawrence.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p>Mid October. The Queen of the Fleet, the
finest transport of the Pacific service, thronged
with boys in blue at last ordered on to Manila,
lay at the wharf at Honolulu, awaiting her
commander&#8217;s orders to cast loose. In strong
force, and with stentorian voices, the Primeval
Dudes joined in rollicking chorus to the crashing
accompaniment of their band and, when
they could take time to rest, the crowd ashore
set up a cheer. The Hawaiian National Band,
in spotless white, forming a huge and melodious
circle on the wharf, vied with the musicians
from the States in the spirit and swing of their
stirring airs. &#8220;<i>Aloha Oe! Aloha Oe!</i>&#8221; chorused
the surging throng, afloat and ashore, as
wreaths and garlands&mdash;the <i>leis</i> of the islanders&mdash;were
twined or hung about some favorite
officer or favored man. The troops still held to
service in Hawaii shouted good will and good-by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
to those ordered on to the Philippines.
The Dudes of the Queen, and the lads from the
prairies and the mountains on other transports
anchored in the deep but narrow harbor, yelled
soldierly condolence to those condemned to stay.
The steam of the &#8217;scape pipe roared loudly and
belched dense white clouds on high, swelling
the uproar. Dusky little Kanaka boys, diving
for nickels and paddling tireless about the
ship, added their shrill cries to the clamor.
The captain, in his natty uniform of blue and
gold, stepped forth upon the bridge to take
command, and raised his banded cap in recognition
of the constant cheer from the host ashore
and the throng of blue shirts on the forecastle
head. Then arose another shout, as a veteran
officer, in the undress uniform of a general, appeared
upon that sacred bound, and, bowing
to the crowd, was escorted by the captain to the
end overlooking the animated scene below; and
then the signal was given, the heavy lines were
cast off and hauled swiftly in, the massive
screw began slowly to churn the waters at the
stern, and gently, almost imperceptibly at first,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
the Queen slid noiselessly along the edge of the
dock, to the accompaniment of a little volley of
flowers and garlands tossed from eager hands,
and a cheer of godspeed from the swarm of upturned
faces. And then there uprose another
shout, a shout of mingled merriment, surprise
and applause; for all on a sudden there darted
up the stairway from the crowded promenade
deck to the sacred perch above, defiant of the
lettered warning, &#8220;Passengers are not allowed
upon the Bridge,&#8221; a dainty vision in filmy
white, and all in the next moment there appeared
at the General&#8217;s side, smiling, bowing, blowing
kisses, waving adieux, all sparkle, animation,
radiance and rejoicing, a bewitching little
figure in the airiest, loveliest of summer toilets.
The Red Cross nurses on the deck below
looked at one another and gasped. Two brave
army girls, wives of wounded officers in the
Philippines, who, by special dispensation, were
making the voyage on the Queen, glanced
quickly at each other and said&mdash;nothing audible.
The General, lifting his cap, but looking
both deprecation and embarrassment, fell back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
and gave his place at the white rail to the new
arrival, and colored high when she suddenly
turned and took his arm. The captain, trying
not to see her or to appear conscious of this infraction
of a stringent rule and invasion of his
dignity, grew redder as he shouted rapid orders
and swung his big, beautiful ship well out into
the stream. The guns of the Bennington
boomed a deafening salute as the Queen turned
her sharp nose toward the open sea; and almost
the last thing Honolulu saw of her human
freight was the tiny, dainty, winsome little
figure in white, waving a spotless kerchief as
in fond farewell. Once clear of the narrow
entrance the big troop ship headed westward
toward the setting sun, shook free the reins, as
it were, and, followed by less favored craft,
sped swiftly on her way, Witchie Garrison,
the latest addition to the passenger list, entirely
at home, if not actually in command.
</p>
<p>Leaning on the General&#8217;s arm an hour later
and deftly piloting that bewildered veteran up
and down the breezy deck, she came, just as
she had planned to come, face to face once more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
with Stanley Armstrong. Well she knew that
under the escort of that exalted rank she was
safe from any possibility of cross question or
interference. Well she knew that had he heard
of her sudden determination to go to Honolulu
she could not have escaped stern interrogation,
possibly something worse; and her heart failed
her when she realized that the man who had
gauged her shallow nature years before, now
held a lash over her head in the shape of the
paper that mad vanity had prompted her to
write and send to the officer of the guard the
day that Stewart sailed. What madness it
was, indeed, yet how could she have dreamed
it would fall into the hands of the man of all
others she feared and respected&mdash;the one man
who, had he but cared, could years ago have had
her love, the man who, because he cared not,
had won her hate! And, now that he held or
had held this paper&mdash;nothing less than a forged
order in her husband&#8217;s name as aide-de-camp
to General Drayton, she could have cowered at
his feet in her terror of him, yet braved him
with smiles, sweetness and gayety, with arch
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
merriment and joyous words, quitting for the
moment the General&#8217;s arm that she might extend
to him both her little white-gloved hands.
Gravely he took the left in his left while with
the right he raised his forage cap in combined
salute to the woman and to his superior officer.
Gravely and almost instantly he released it,
and listened in helpless patience to her torrent
of playful words; but his eyes were on the General&#8217;s
face as though he would ask could he, the
General, know the true character of the woman
he had honored above all her sisterhood on
board, in thus taking her to the bridge whereon
neither officer nor man nor nurse nor army wife
had presumed to set foot on all the six days&#8217; run
from San Francisco, as though he would ask if
the General knew just what she was, this
blithe, dainty, winsome little thing that nestled
so confidingly&mdash;indeed, so snugly&mdash;close to his
battered side, and who had virtually taken possession
of him in the face of an envious and not
too silent circle of her own sex. Truth to tell,
the Chief would rather have escaped. He was
but an indifferent sailor, and the Queen&#8217;s long,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
lazy roll over the ocean surges was exciting
in his inner consciousness a longing for cracked
ice and champagne. He had known her but
the few days the Queen remained in port, coaling
and preparing for the onward voyage across
the broad Pacific; but a great functionary of
the general government had told him a pathetic
tale the very day of his first peep at the Royal
Hawaiian Hotel, had given him a capital dinner
at that famous hostelry, whereat she appeared
in charming attire, and in a flow of
spirits simply irresistible. Her sallies of wit
had made him roar with delight; her mimicry
of one or two conscientious but acidulated
dames who had come over on the Queen, bound
as nurses for Manila, had tickled him to the
verge of apoplexy; but when later she backed
him into the coolest corner of the &#8220;lanai&#8221; with
the plash of fountain close at hand, and the
sweet music of Berger&#8217;s famous band floating
softly on the evening air, and told him how her
father had loved to talk of his, the General&#8217;s,
dash and daring in the great days of the great
war, and led him on to tell of his campaigns in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
the Shenandoah and the West, listening with
dilated eyes and parted lips, the campaigner
himself was captivated, and she had her will.
A great senator had told him how she had
come thither to nurse a gallant young officer in
her husband&#8217;s regiment, how she had pulled
the boy through the perils of brain fever until
he was now convalescent and going on to rejoin
his comrades in Manila, and she, she was pining
to reach her husband now serving on General
Drayton&#8217;s staff. Other women were
aboard the Queen; could not General Crabb
find room for her? It is hard for a soldier to
refuse a pretty woman&mdash;or a prominent member
of the committee on military affairs. There
was not a vacant stateroom on the ship.
Officers were sleeping three or four in a room,
so were the Red Cross nurses; and the two army
wives already aboard had been assigned a little
cubby-hole of a cabin in which only one could
dress at a time. There were only two apartments
on the big craft that were not filled to
their capacity&mdash;the room occupied by that sea
monarch, the captain, and that which, from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
having been the &#8220;Ladies&#8217; Boudoir,&#8221; had
been fitted up for the accommodation of
the General. The piano had been wheeled
out on deck, the writing table stowed away,
and a fine new wide brass bedstead, with
dainty white curtains and mosquito bar, a
large bureau and a washstand had been moved
in, and these, with easy-chairs, electric fans,
electric lights and abundant air, made it the
most desirable room on the ship. Even Armstrong,
colonel commanding the troops aboard,
was compelled to share his little cabin with his
adjutant, and the General&#8217;s aides were bundled
into a &#8220;skimpy&#8221; box between decks. There
really seemed no place for Mrs. Garrison
aboard, especially when it was found that the
passenger list was to be increased by three, a
surgeon and two officers going forward from
Honolulu; and one of these was our old friend
and once light-hearted Billy Gray, now nearly
convalescent, but weak and, as all could see,
feverishly eager to get on to Manila.
</p>
<p>All this was explained to the senator. It
was even suggested that there was room for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
Mrs. Garrison on the Louisiana, a safe old tub,
if she was slow; but Mrs. Frank looked so
pathetic and resigned when this arrangement
was suggested that no one had the hardihood to
actually dwell upon it, and the senator said it
was a shame to think of it. With whom of
her own sex could she associate on that long,
hot voyage ahead of them? Why not transfer
some of the Red Cross nurses to the Louisiana?
Mrs. Garrison had no objections, but they had;
and the surgeon in charge made prompt and
vigorous protest. He knew Mrs. Frank, and
she knew him and did not in the least despair.
She still had a plan. There was a cozy dinner
one evening&mdash;just the evening before the departure
of the Queen, and the gallant captain
of the ship, the veteran General, the quartermaster
in charge of transportation, the member
of the senate military committee, some charming
girls,&mdash;but none so charming as Mrs. Garrison,&mdash;were
of the party. There was some sentiment
and much champagne, as a result of
which, at one <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A.M.</span>, the big-hearted sea monarch
aforementioned swore by the bones of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
ancestors in the slimy grasp of Davy Jones that
that sweet little woman shouldn&#8217;t have to go
a-begging for accommodations on his ship. If
the General would condescend to move into his
room, by thunder, he&#8217;d sleep up in his foul-weather
den next the chart room, and Mrs.
Garrison&mdash;God bless her!&mdash;could take the General&#8217;s
room, and be queen of the ship&mdash;queen
of the Queen&mdash;queen of queens&mdash;by Jupiter!
and here&#8217;s her health with all honor! A
soldier, of course, could be no less gallant than
a sailor, especially as the captain&#8217;s room was
a bit better than the &#8220;Boudoir,&#8221; and had an ice
chest and contents that the veteran campaigner
was bidden to consider his own. The agreement
was clinched that very night before the
party broke up; and little Mrs. Frank shed
tears of gratitude upon the General&#8217;s coat sleeve
and threw kiss after kiss to the handsome sailor
as she hung over the balusters of the broad
veranda and waved them away in their swift-running
cabs, and then danced off to her room
and threw herself on the bed after a mad
pirouette about the spacious apartment, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
laughed and laughed until real tears trickled
from her eyes, and then gave orders to be called
at seven o&#8217;clock. She meant to be up and
aboard that ship with all her luggage before
sense and repentance could come with the morning
sun&mdash;before either soldier or sailor could
change his mind.
</p>
<p>To the amaze of the women already aboard,
to the grave annoyance of Colonel Armstrong,
to the joy of poor Billy Gray, and the mischievous
merriment of several youngsters on the
commissioned list, Mrs. Frank Garrison, the
latest arrival, became sole occupant of the finest
room on the ship; and it was a bower of lilies
and tropical fruit and flowers the breezy day
she sailed away from the bay of Honolulu.
</p>
<p>No time need be wasted in telling the effect
of this &#8220;assignment to quarters.&#8221; Prolific a
source of squabble as is the custom ashore it becomes
intensified afloat, and, when coupled
with it, came a shaking up and rearrangement
of seats at table, all hope of harmony vanished
on the instant. The two brave young
army girls still retained their seats at the captain&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
table; but two most estimable young
women, Red Cross nurses, were dropped therefrom
and transferred to that of the second officer
on the port side, much to the comfort of a rather
large percentage of their sisterhood who had
regarded their previous elevation with feelings
of not unmixed gratification. Then officers
who had been seated with the General&#8217;s staff
had to vacate in favor of Mrs. Frank and Dr.
Prober and Lieutenant Billy Gray, whose
father and the chief were long-time chums, and
the Red Cross nurses who had been at the first
officer&#8217;s table fell back to that of the third. It
was every bit as good as the other, but it didn&#8217;t
sound so, and they couldn&#8217;t see it; and there
were faces sour as the product of the ship&#8217;s
baker when that evening all hands went down
to dinner, and the silence maintained, or the
ominously subdued tone of the talk, at the other
tables, was in marked contrast with the hilarity
that prevailed where sat the gray-haired,
ruddy-cheeked old chief and the laughing coterie
that listened to the fun that fell from the lips
of Witchie Garrison. Armstrong, silent and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
somber, at the captain&#8217;s right, looking forward
from time to time, saw only one face at the
General&#8217;s table that was not lighted up with
merriment; it was the face of the boy he envied,
if envy of this kind ever entered into his heart,
and he wondered as he looked at Billy&#8217;s curly
head what could have come over that glad
young life to leave so deep a shadow on his
handsome face.
</p>
<p>One night, just one week later, Armstrong&#8217;s
eyes were opened. More than once in the
meanwhile he had invited the young officer&#8217;s
confidence, and Billy, who three months earlier
had been all gratitude and frankness, protested
there was nothing on his mind. He had been
very ill, that was all. As to Canker&#8217;s charges
they were simply rot. He hadn&#8217;t the faintest
inkling what had become of the purloined letters
any more than he had of the whereabouts
of his Delta Sig friend, young Morton, now
officially proclaimed a deserter. But Armstrong
heard more tales of Witchie&#8217;s devotions
to him in his illness, and the slow convalescence
that ensued, noted how the boy&#8217;s eyes followed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
her about the deck, and how many a time he
would seek her side, even when other men were
reading, walking or chatting with her. Armstrong
looked with wonderment that was close
allied to incredulity and pain. Was it possible
that this blithe lad, who had won such a warm
interest in the heart of such a girl as Amy
Lawrence, could be forgetful of her, faithless to
her, and fascinated now by this selfish and
shallow butterfly? It was incredible!
</p>
<p>But was it? The days had grown hotter, the
nights closer, and the air between decks was
stifling when the sea rolled high and closed the
ports. Officers had taken to snoozing up on
deck in steamer chairs. By an unwritten law
the port side of the promenade deck was given
up to them after eleven at night; but the women
folk had the run of the starboard side at any
hour when the crew were not washing down
decks. Armstrong had been far forward about
two o&#8217;clock one breathless night to see for himself
the condition of things in the hospital under
the forecastle. The main deck was crowded
with sleeping forms of soldiers who found it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
impossible to stand the heat below; so on his
return, instead of continuing along the gangway,
he decided to climb the iron ladder from
the main to the promenade deck. It would
land him at the forward end on the starboard
side. There he could smoke a cigar in peace
and quiet. It was high time everybody was
asleep.
</p>
<p>But as his head and eyes reached the level of
the deck he became suddenly aware of a couple
huddled close together in the shelter of a canvas
screen, and under the steps leading aloft to the
bridge. He knew Gray&#8217;s voice at once, and
Gray was pleading. He knew <i>her</i> tones of old,
and she was imperative, and listening with
obvious impatience, for, almost at the instant
of his arrival, she spoke, low, yet distinctly.
&#8220;Do as I say; do as I <i>beg</i> you when we reach
Manila, and then come&mdash;and see how I can reward.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p>Manila at last! Queen city of the Archipelago,
and Manila again besieged! The loveliest
of the winter months was come. The
Luneta and the Paseo de Santa Lucia, close to
the sparkling waters, were gay every evening
with the music of the regimental bands and
thronged with the carriages of old-time residents
and their new and not too welcome visitors.
Spanish dames and damsels, invisible at other
hours, drove or strolled along the roadway to
enjoy the cool breezes that swept in from the
beautiful bay and wistful peeps at the dainty
toilets of the American belles now arriving by
every boat from Hongkong. All the Castilian
disdain they might look and possibly feel
toward the soldiery of Uncle Sam gave place to
liveliest interest and curiosity when the wives
and daughters of his soldiers appeared upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
scene; and there was one carriage about which,
whenever it stopped, a little swarm of officers
gathered and toward which at any time all eyes
were directed&mdash;that of the White Sisters.
Within the old walled city and in the crowded
districts of Binondo, Quiapo and San Miguel
north of the Pasig, and again in Paco and
Ermita to the south, strong regiments were
stationed in readiness to suppress the first sign
of the outbreak so confidently predicted by the
Bureau of Military Intelligence. In a great
semicircle of over twenty miles, girdling the city
north, east and south, the outposts and sentries
of the two divisions kept watchful eyes upon
the Insurgent forces surrounding them. Aguinaldo
and his cabinet at Malolos to the north
had all but declared war upon the obstinate
possessors of the city and had utterly forbidden
their leaving the lines of Manila and seeking to
penetrate those broader fields and roads and villages
without. Still hugging to its breast the
delusion that a semi-Malaysian race could be
appeased by show of philanthropy, the government
at Washington decreed that, despite their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
throwing up earthworks against and training
guns on the American positions, the enemy
should be treated as though they never could
or would be hostile, and the privileges denied
by them to American troops were by the
American troops accorded to them. Coming
and going at will through our lines, they
studied our force, our arms, equipment, numbers,
supplies, methods; and long before the
Christmas bells had clanged their greeting to
that universal feast day, and the boom of cannon
ushered in the new year, all doubt of the
hostile sentiments of the Insurgent leaders had
vanished. Already there had been ominous
clashes at the front; and with every day the
demeanor of the Philippine officers and men became
more and more insolent and defiant.
Ceaseless vigilance and self-control were enjoined
upon the soldiers of the United States,
nearly all stalwart volunteers from the far
West, and while officers of the staff and of the
half-dozen regiments quartered within the city
were privileged each day to stroll or drive upon
the Luneta, there were others that never knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
an hour away from the line of the outposts and
their supports. Such was the case with
Stewart&#8217;s regiment far out toward the waterworks
at the east. Such was the case with the
Primeval Dudes on the other side of the Pasig,
lining the banks of the crooked estuary that
formed the Rubicon we were forbidden to cross.
Such was the case with Canker and the &mdash;teenth
in the dense bamboo thicket to the south, and
so it happened that at first Armstrong and Billy
Gray saw nothing of each other, and but little
of the White Sisters, probably a fortunate thing
for all.
</p>
<p>Ever since that memorable night on the
Queen of the Fleet, Gray had studiously avoided
his whilom friend and counselor, while the latter&#8217;s
equally studious avoidance of Mrs. Garrison
had become observed throughout the ship.
The dominion and power of that little lady had
been of brief duration, as was to be expected in
the case of a woman who had secured for her
undivided use the best, the airiest and by far
the largest room on the steamer&mdash;a <i>cabine de
luxe</i> indeed, that for a week&#8217;s voyage on an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
Atlantic liner would have cost a small fortune,
while here for a sea sojourn of more than
double the time, under tropic skies, and while
other and worthier women were sweltering three
in a stuffy box below, it had cost but a smile.
The captain had repented him of his magnanimity
before the lights of Honolulu faded out
astern. The General began to realize that he
had been made a cat&#8217;s-paw of and, his <i>amour
propre</i> being wounded, he had essayed for a day
or two majestic dignity of mien that became
comical when complicated with the qualms of
seasickness. There was even noticeable aversion
on part of some of the officers of the Dudes
who, having made the journey from &#8220;the Bay&#8221;
to Honolulu with the women passengers, army
wives and Red Cross nurses, naturally became
the recipients of the views entertained by these
ladies. Quick to see if slow to seem to see,
Mrs. Frank had lost no time in begging one of
the young soldier wives to share her big stateroom
and broad and comfortable bed, and the
lady preferred the heat and discomfort between-decks
to separation from her friend. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
Mrs. Garrison tendered both the run of her
cabin during the day and evening; suggested,
indeed, that on hot nights they come and sleep
there, one on the bed and one on the couch; and
they thanked her, but&mdash;never came. She coddled
the General with cool champagne cup when he
was in the throes of <i>mal de mer</i>, and held him
prisoner with her vivacious chatter when he
was well enough to care to talk. But, after
all, her most serious trouble seemed to consist
in keeping Billy Gray at respectful distance.
He sought her side day after day, to Armstrong&#8217;s
mild amaze, as has been said; and when
he could not be with her was moody, even
fierce and ugly tempered&mdash;he whose disposition
had been the sunniest in all that gray, shivery,
dripping sojourn at the San Francisco camp.
</p>
<p>But once fairly settled in Manila, the White
Sisters seemed to regain all the old ascendency.
Colonel Frost had taken a big, cool, roomy
house, surrounded by spacious grounds down
in Malate and close to the plashing waters of
the bay. Duties kept him early and late at his
office in the walled city; but every evening,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
after the drive and dinner, callers came
thronging in, and all Witchie&#8217;s witcheries were
called into play to charm them into blindness
and to cover Nita&#8217;s fitful and nervous moods,
now almost painfully apparent. Frost&#8217;s face
was at times a thundercloud, and army circles
within the outer circle of Manila saw plainly
that all was not harmony betwixt that veteran
Benedict and that fragile, fluttering, baby
wife. The bloom of Nita&#8217;s beauty was gone.
She looked wan, white, even haggard. She
had refused to leave Hongkong or come to
Manila until Margaret&#8217;s arrival, then flew to
the shelter of that sisterly wing. Frank Garrison
had been occupying a room under the
same roof with his General, but both General
and aide-de-camp were now much afield, and
Frank spent far more days and nights along
the line of blockhouses than he did at home.
The coming of his wife was unannounced and
utterly unlooked for. &#8220;Did I consult my husband!&#8221;
she exclaimed in surprise, when asked
the question one day by the wife of a veteran
field officer. &#8220;Merciful heaven, Mrs. Lenox,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
there was no time for that except by cable, and
at four dollars a word. No! If any doubt of
what Frank Garrison will say or do exists in
my mind I go and do the thing at once, then
the doubt is settled. If he approve, well and
good; if he doesn&#8217;t&mdash;well, then I&#8217;ve had my fun
anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But it made little difference what Frank
Garrison might think, say or do when Nita&#8217;s
need came in question. It was for Nita that
Margaret Garrison so suddenly quitted the
Presidio and hastened to Hawaii. It was for
her sake, to be her counsel and protection, the
elder sister had braved refusal, difficulties,
criticism, even Armstrong&#8217;s open suspicion and
dislike, to take that long voyage to a hostile
clime. That she braved, too, her husband&#8217;s
displeasure was not a matter of sufficient weight
to merit consideration. She was there to help
Nita; and until that hapless child were freed
from a peril that, ever threatening, seemed sapping
her very life, Margaret Garrison meant
to stay.
</p>
<p>For the letter that came by way of Honolulu
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
had told the elder sister of increasing jealousy
and suspicion on the colonel&#8217;s part, of his
dreadful rage at Yokohama on learning that
even there&mdash;the very hour of their arrival&mdash;when
the consul came aboard with a batch of
letters in his hand, he had one for Mrs. Frost.
She had barely glanced at its contents before
she was stricken with a fit of trembling, tore it
in half, and tossed the fragments on the swift
ebbing tide, then rushed to her stateroom. There
she added a postscript to the long letter penned
to Margaret on the voyage; and the purser, not
her husband, saw it safely started on the Gaelic,
leaving for San Francisco via Honolulu
that very day. That letter beat the ordinary
mail, for the Queen was heading seaward, even
as the Gaelic came steaming in the coral-guarded
harbor, and a little packet was tossed
aboard the new troop ship as she sped away,
one missive in it telling Witchie Garrison that
the man whose life had been wrecked by her
sister&#8217;s enforced desertion was already in
Manila awaiting her coming, and telling her,
moreover, that the packet placed in General
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
Drayton&#8217;s hands contained only her earlier letters.
In his reckless wrath Latrobe had told
her that those which bound her to him by the
most solemn pledges, those that vowed undying
love and devotion, were still in his hands, and
that she should see him and them when at last
she reached Manila.
</p>
<p>Three mortal weeks had the sisters been there
together, and never once in that time did Nita
venture forth except when under escort of her
black-browed husband or the protection of her
smiling, witching, yet vigilant Margaret.
Never once had their house been approached by
any one who bore resemblance to the dreaded
lover. All along the Calle Real, where were
the quarters of many officers, little guards of
regulars were stationed; for black rumors of
Filipino uprising came with every few days,
and some men&#8217;s hearts were failing them for
fear when they thought of the paucity of their
numbers as compared with the thousands of
fanatical natives to whom the taking of human
life was of less account than the loss of a game
chicken, and in whose sight assassination was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
a virtue when it rid one of a foe. Already
many an officer who had weakly yielded to the
importunity of a devoted wife was cursing the
folly that led him to let her join him. The
outbreak was imminent. Any one could see the
war was sure to come&mdash;even those who strove
to banish alarm and reassure an anxious nation.
And when the call to arms should sound, duty,
honor and law would demand each soldier&#8217;s instant
answer on the battle line, then who was
to care for the women? The very servants in
each household, it was known, were in most
cases regularly enrolled in the Insurgent army.
The crowded districts in the city, the nipa huts
surrounding the wealthy homes in the suburbs
swarmed with Filipino soldiery in the garb of
peace. Arms and ammunition, both, were
stored in the great stone churches. Knives,
bolos and pistols were hidden in every house.
Through the clergy, in some instances, and
foreign residents in others, the statement was
set afloat that every American officer&#8217;s residence
was mapped and marked, that the Tagals were
told off by name&mdash;so many for each house in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
proportion to the number of American inmates&mdash;and
day after day, awaiting the signal for
their bloody work, these native devotees greeted
with servile bows and studied the habits of the
officers they were designated to fall upon in
their sleep and slay without mercy. Even
women and children were not to be spared; and
many a woman, hearing this grewsome story,
trembled in her terror. For a time, in dread
of this new peril, Nita Frost almost forgot the
other; but not so Margaret. She scoffed and
scouted the rumor of Filipino outbreak. She
laughed at Frost, who all too evidently believed
in it, and was in hourly trepidation. He
begged that the guard at his quarters might be
doubled, and was totally unnerved when told it
might even have to be reduced. Not so Mrs.
Frank. She made friends with the stalwart
sergeant commanding; always had hot coffee
and sandwiches ready for the midnight relief;
made it a point to learn the name of each successive
noncommissioned officer in charge, and
had a winsome smile and word for the sentries
as she passed. It wasn&#8217;t Filipino aggression
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
that she feared. The men wondered why she
should so urgently bid them see that no
strangers&mdash;Americans&mdash;were allowed within
the massive gates. There were tramps, even
in Manila, she said. When the sisters drove,
their natty little Filipino team flashed through
the lanes and streets at top speed, the springy
Victoria bounding at their heels to the imminent
peril of the cockaded hats of the dusky
coach and footman, if not even to the seats of
those trim, white-coated, big-buttoned, top-booted,
impassive little Spanish-bred servitors.
The carriage stopped only at certain designated
points, and only then when a group of officers
stood ready to greet them. Not once had they
been menaced by any one nor approached by
any man even faintly resembling poor Latrobe;
and Witchie Garrison was beginning to take
heart and look upon that threatening letter as a
mad piece of &#8220;bluff&#8221; when one day the unexpected
happened.
</p>
<p>The men of the house, Frost and Garrison,
were accustomed, when the latter was at home,
to breakfast together quite early. Then the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
colonel would drive off to the Ayuntamiento in
the walled city, and Frank would mount his
pony and ride away to his long day&#8217;s duties.
Later the sisters would have their leisurely
breakfast, secure in the protection of the guard,
would give their Chinaman <i>chef</i> his orders for
the day, and send him off to make such purchases
as were possible in the now scanty
market. Then reading, writing, receiving callers
of their own sex would fill up the morning.
There would be a brief siesta after luncheon,
an hour or so on the broad veranda overlooking
the sparkling bay, then dress and the inevitable
drive. Of Armstrong they had seen nothing,
heard next to nothing. He was busy with
his men over toward East Paco. Of Billy
Gray of late they had seen rather too much.
On one pretext after another he was now forever
coming to the house, and Witchie was beginning
to wish that Canker had had his way;
but Canker had failed dismally. The witnesses
he counted on proved dumb or departed, and it
had pleased the General-in-Chief to send him
with a regiment of infantry and a brace of guns
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
to garrison an important point on an adjacent
island, and to tell him that in view of the impossibility
of his substantiating his charges
against Gray the youngster had some shadow
of excuse for his violent outbreak. Rather than
bring up a scandal it was best to drop the matter
entirely. Gray had been sent to duty with
the &mdash;&mdash;teenth before he was thoroughly well, and
a good-hearted battalion commander, taking
pity on his obvious change for the worse, had
found occasion after the first ten days at the
front to send him back to quarters in Malate,
instead of incessantly on duty along the threatened
line toward Singalon Church; and while
he seldom came in the evening when numbers
of visitors were present, the boy had a way of
dropping in between three and four, when he
could generally count on a few moments, at
least, alone with Mrs. Frank. She had nursed
him well in his slow convalescence, had made
deep impression on his boyish heart, lacerated
as he conceived it by a disappointment at home.
She had won him to her service, as she thought,
until she felt sure he was ready to do almost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
anything for her sake, then she had put him to
the test, and he had failed her. Believing, as
she did, that the boy well knew the whereabouts
of the alleged deserter, Morton, and his
friend, Nita&#8217;s reckless lover, she had counted
on him to wring from them the letters poor
Latrobe declared he still possessed; but the
three weeks had passed without a sign, and it
was becoming evident to her that Gray had lost
track of them entirely.
</p>
<p>One brilliant afternoon, as she lay on the
broad, cane-bottomed bedstead with its overhanging
canopy of filmy netting, she drowsily
heard the corporal posting the new sentry in
the marbled corridor below, and then marching
the relief to the rear gate opening to the beach.
Nita was already up and moving about in her
room. Margaret heard the rustle of her skirts
and the light patter of her tiny feet as she sped
over the hardwood floor of the main <i>salon</i>. She
heard her throwing back the sliding shutters
that kept out the glare of the sun in the morning
hours, and knew that she was gazing out
over the tree-dotted lawn toward the gate where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
the guard lounged through the warm afternoon.
All of a sudden, quick and stirring, a bugle
sounded over on the Calle Nueva, where the
North Dakotas had a strong detachment. The
call was repeated, and, army woman though
she was, she did not recognize it. She could
not remember ever having heard it before.
Then up the street, from the Engineer barrack,
there came thrilling echo, and there was a
sound of movement and excitement along the
dusty thoroughfare. She heard Nita calling
her name, and then the child&#8217;s quick, nervous
step along the hallway toward the stairs.
Then came a sudden stop, a gasping, wailing
cry, and, springing from her bed and to the
door, Margaret found her sister cowering before
a tall, slender man in the rough dress and field
equipment of a private soldier. With a little
packet&mdash;letters, apparently&mdash;held forth in one
hand, while the other grasped her wrist, Rollin
Latrobe stood sternly gazing at the girl shrinking
at his feet.
</p>
<p>The tableau was over in another second.
Springing up the broad marble stairs came Billy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
Gray, the corporal of the guard at his heels,
and Latrobe saw his danger in a flash.
Throwing little Gray aside as he would a terrier,
the young athlete whirled on the stalwart
regular. There was the sound of a crashing
blow, followed by a heavy fall. The corporal
went rolling down the steps with Latrobe
bounding over the tumbling form, and the next
instant he had vaulted over the ledge of the
open window on the lower floor, and vanished
through the gateway to the beach. And now
all along the Calle Real the bugles were sounding
&#8220;To Arms!&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p>That was a wild day in Manila. Far over
near the Escolta somebody shot at a vagrant
dog lapping water from a little pool under one
of the many hydrants. The soldier police
essayed an arrest; the culprit broke and ran;
the guard fired; a lot of coolies, taking alarm,
fled jabbering to the river side. The natives,
looking for trouble any moment, rushed to their
homes. Some soldiers on pass and unarmed
tumbled over the tables and chairs in the
Alhambra in their dash for the open street.
A stampeded sergeant told a bugler to sound
to arms, and in the twinkling of an eye the
call was taken up from barrack to barrack,
and the news went flashing out by wire to the
extreme front. The shopkeepers hastily put
up their shutters and bolted their doors.
Cabs, carts, <i>quilez</i> and <i>carromattas</i>&mdash;even the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
street cars&mdash;were instantly seized by the soldiery
scattered all over town, and utilized to take
them tearing back to join their regiments. In
five minutes the business streets down town
were deserted. Chinese cowered within their
crowded huts. The natives, men and women,
either hid within the shelter of their homes or
fled to the sanctuary of the many churches.
All over the great city the alarm spread like
wildfire. The battalions formed under arms,
those nearest the outer lines being marched at
once to their positions in support, those nearer
the walled city waiting for orders. Foreign
residents took matters more coolly than did the
Asiatic; German phlegm, English impassibility
and Yankee devil-may-carishness preventing
a panic. But those who had families and
owned or could hire carriages and launches
were not slow in seeking for their households
the refuge of the fleet of transports lying
placidly at anchor in the bay, where Dewey&#8217;s
bluejackets shifted their quids, went coolly to
their stations and, grouped about their guns,
quietly awaiting further developments. In an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
agony of fear Colonel Frost had bidden his
driver to lash the ponies to a gallop and go like
the wind to Malate; but the appearance of the
long ranks of sturdy infantry resting on their
arms and beginning to look bored, measurably
reassured him before he reached his home.
Once there, however, the sight of Nita, clinging
hysterically to her sister and moaning on
her bed was sufficient to determine his first
move, which was to wire for his launch to
come around to the bay shore and take them off
to the fleet. The next was to send and ask for
an officer and twenty men from the Cuartel, on
receiving which message the major commanding,
standing on the dusty roadway in front of
his men, grinned under his grizzled mustache
and said, &#8220;Frost&#8217;s got &#8217;em again. Here, Gray,
you go over and tell him to keep his hair on,
that it&#8217;s nothing but a fake alarm.&#8221; And
Gray, glad enough of the chance to go again
into the presence of the woman who so fascinated
him, sped on his mission. He was in a
fury over his recent humiliation in her very
sight&mdash;he, a commissioned officer, tossed aside
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
like a child and outwitted by this daring intruder
in the shape of a private soldier&mdash;he and
his guard brushed away and derided by a young
fellow in some strange regiment&mdash;who had
easily escaped along the beach to an adjoining
inclosure into which he darted and was no more
seen. The streets were full of scurrying
soldiers, and it was the simplest thing in the
world for him to mingle with them and make
his way to his own command. Of course, Gray
well knew who the man must be&mdash;Nita&#8217;s troublesome
lover of whom Witchie had told him
so much. There was his chance to recover the
letters and claim the reward; but man and letters
both had escaped his grasp; and when he
pulled up, blown and exhausted after fruitless
chase, he was brought to his senses by the sight
of his own men falling in &#8220;for business,&#8221; and
he had to scamper for his sword and join
them.
</p>
<p>That was a miserable evening. Margaret
Garrison was the only member of the household
who seemed to have her wits about her and her
nerves under control, for Frank, her liege lord,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
had his duty elsewhere, and not until hours
later trotted slowly home. Margaret plainly
let Gray understand how he had fallen in her
estimation at being so easily tossed aside. A
warning finger was laid upon her lips. &#8220;Not
one word of what has happened while he is
here,&#8221; she muttered; and a nod of her fluffy
head toward the perturbed colonel told plainly
that the chief of the household really had no
place in the family councils. To the sisters
that alarm was a blessing in disguise. It was
all sufficient to account for Nita&#8217;s prostration.
To the rash and reckless lad, who, claiming to
be an orderly with a letter from the colonel,
had been passed by the gate guard to the open
stairway, it afforded ample cover for escape,
when, alarmed by Nita&#8217;s cry, Gray and the
corporal came springing to her aid. To Gray
himself it gave only a few minutes&#8217; forgetfulness
of his trouble, for, smarting under the
sting of a woman&#8217;s only half-hidden disdain, he
would have welcomed with almost savage joy
some fierce battle with a skillful foe, some scene
in which he could compel her respect and admiration.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
He was still smarting and stung
when at last that opportunity came.
</p>
<p>Long will Manila remember the night! It
followed close upon the heels of warnings that
for weeks held every officer and man to his post
of duty. Day after day the strain increased.
The Insurgents, crowding upon our outposts in
front of Santa Mesa on the north and of Santa
Ana on the south side of the Pasig, had
heaped insult and threats upon our silent sentries,
compelled by orders to the very last to
submit to anything but actual attack rather
than bring on a battle. &#8220;The Americans are
afraid,&#8221; was the gleeful cry of Aguinaldo&#8217;s
officers, the jeer and taunt of his men. The
regulars were soon to come and replace those
volunteers, said the wiseacre of his cabinet,
therefore strike now before the trained and disciplined
troops arrive and sweep these big
boors into the sea. And on the still, starlit
night, sooner perhaps than his confederates
within the walls intended, the rebel leader
struck, and, long before the dawn of the lovely
Sunday morn that followed, the fire flashed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
from forty thousand rifles in big semicircle
around Manila, and the long-expected battle
was on.
</p>
<p>Hours after dawn, hours after the attack began,
the &mdash;teenth were in extended battle order
to the south of Malate confronted by thickets of
bamboo that fairly swarmed with Insurgents,
yet, only by the incessant zip and &#8220;whiew&#8221; of
their deadly missiles and the ceaseless crackle of
rifle fire, could this be determined; for with their
smokeless powder and their Indian-like skill in
concealment nothing could be seen of their array.
Over to the westward on the placid waters of
the bay the huge Monadnock was driving shell
after shell into the dense underbrush across the
abandoned rice fields and the marshy flats that
lined the shore. Over to the east resounding
cheers and crashing volleys, punctuated by the
sharp report of field guns, told that the comrade
brigade was heavily engaged and, apparently,
driving the enemy before them. To right and
left their volunteer supports were banging into
the brush with their heavy Springfields; and
still there seemed no symptom of weakness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
along the immediate front, no sign of yielding.
If anything the fury of the Insurgent volleying
increased as the sun climbed higher, and all
along the blue-shirted line men grit their teeth
and swore as they crouched or lay full length
along the roadside, peering through the filmy
veil that drifted slowly across their front&mdash;the
smoke from the Springfields of the volunteers.
To lie there longer with the bullets buzzing
close overhead or biting deep into the low embankment,
sometimes tearing a stinging path
through human flesh and bone, was adding to
the nerve strain of the hours gone by. To rush
headlong across that intervening open space,
through deep and muddy pools and stagnant
ditch, and hurl themselves upon the lurking
enemy in the bamboo copse beyond, had been
the ardent longing of the line since daylight
came to illumine the field before them. Yet
stern orders withheld: Defend, but do not advance,
said the General&#8217;s message; and the
whisper went along from man to man. &#8220;There
is trouble in town behind us, and the chief may
need us there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>But, as eight o&#8217;clock passed with no word of
uprising in the rear, and the cheering over
toward Santa Ana grew loud and louder, the
nerve strain upon the &mdash;teenth became well-nigh
intolerable. &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, can&#8217;t we
be doing something instead of lying here firing
into a hornet&#8217;s nest?&#8221; was the murmur that
arose in more than one company along the impatient
line; and the gruff voices of veteran sergeants
could be heard ordering silence, while,
moving up and down behind their men, the line
officers cautioned against waste of ammunition
and needless exposure. &#8220;Lie flat, men. Keep
down!&#8221; were the words. &#8220;We won&#8217;t have to
stand this forever. You&#8217;ll soon get your
chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And presently it came. The cheering that
had died away, far over to the left beyond the
wooded knolls that surrounded Singalon and
Block House 12, was suddenly taken up nearer
at hand. Then crashing volleys sounded along
the narrow roadway to the east, and a bugle
rang out shrill and clear above the noise of
battle; and then closer still, though unseen in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
the gloom of the dense thicket in which they
lay, the men of the second battalion, strung
along a Filipino trail that led away to the rice
fields, swung their big straw hats and yelled
for joy. A young officer, his eyes flashing, his
face flushing with excitement, came bounding
out from the grove at the left of the crouching
line and made straight to where the veteran
battalion commander knelt in rear of his center.
It was Billy Gray, adjutant of the third battalion,
acting that day as adjutant to the regimental
commander. The bullets whistled by
his head as he darted springingly along; and in
their joy at sight of him even old hands forgot
the reserve of the regular service and some man
shouted: &#8220;Now we&#8217;re off!&#8221; and the popular
query: &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Lieutenant
Gray?&#8221;
</p>
<p>At any other time, under any other circumstances
both questioner and respondents who
gleefully shouted &#8220;He&#8217;s all right,&#8221; would have
been promptly and sternly suppressed. But the
senior captain at their head well knew the excitement
tingling in the nerves of that long-suffering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
line, and only smiled and nodded
sympathy. He saw, too, that Gray was quivering
with pent-up feeling, as the boy halted
short, saluted, and, striving to steady his eager
voice, said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain, the colonel directs that you open
sharp fire on the woods in your front and occupy
the enemy there. He is about to charge
with the third battalion and drive them out of
the trenches we&#8217;ve located over yonder;&#8221; and
Billy pointed eagerly to the left front&mdash;the
southeast.
</p>
<p>The captain&#8217;s grizzled face took on a look of
keen disappointment. &#8220;You mean we&#8217;ve got
to stay here, and see you fellows go in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only for a few minutes, sir. The colonel
says that for you to charge before he&#8217;s got onto
their flank would cost too many men. You&#8217;ll
get the word as soon as he&#8217;s got the works.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well said, Billy boy! That sounds almost
epigrammatic. Hullo! You hit? Stoop
down here, man. Don&#8217;t try to get perforated.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My hat only,&#8221; was the answer, as the boy
stooped quickly to hide the irrepressible twitching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
about the muscles of his lips. A Remington
had ripped from side to side, tearing a way
through the curly hair at the top of his head
and almost scoring the scalp. To save his soul
he could not quite suppress the trembling of his
knees; but, steadying himself by a great effort,
he continued: &#8220;The colonel says to commence
firing by volley the moment our bugles sound
the charge. Now I must get back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, youngster. Tell the colonel I
savey, and we&#8217;ll do our level best&mdash;only, let us
into it as quick as you can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Gray heard only the first part of the sentence.
He was panting when he reached his
placid, gray-mustached chief, and could only
gasp out: &#8220;The captain understands, sir.&#8221;
And then the regimental commander simply
turned to the battalion leader, standing silent
at his left in a little clump of timber&mdash;another
veteran captain grown gray as himself in long,
long years of service:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s our time, old man! Pitch in! Gray,
we&#8217;ll go with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All along the line from right to left there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
ran the cross-country road connecting the
broader highway, from Malate to San Rafael
and Parañaque on the west, and from West
Paco by way of Singalon to Pasay. In front
of the right wing all was swamp, morass or
rice fields. In front of the left wing all was
close, dense bamboo and jungle, save where the
broad, straight roadway led on past Block
House 13, or the narrower cart track stretched
southward, overarched in places by spreading
branches, and commanded at its narrowest path
by the swarm of dusky fighters in Block House
14. A year before the blue-shirts stormed
these forest strongholds from the south, and took
them from the troops of Spain. Now they were
compelled to turn and storm them from the
north; for, just as Stanley Armstrong said at
San Francisco, the Filipinos had turned upon
their ally and would-be friend. Aguinaldo
had bearded Uncle Sam.
</p>
<p>And while the volunteers and regulars to the
right could only remain in support, it fell to
the lot of the left wing of this brave brigade to
assault in almost impenetrable position an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
enemy armed with magazine rifles or breech-loaders,
and entirely at home. The bugles rang
the signal; the officers in silence took their stations,
and, stepping into the narrow pathways
through the jungle, crouching along the road-ways
or crashing through the stiff bamboo, the
blue-shirts drove ahead. Two, three minutes,
and their purpose seemed undiscovered. Then
suddenly Block House 14 blazed with fire and
a storm of bullets swept the road. The earthworks
in the thickets to the right and left
seemed to be crowded with a running flame;
and down on their faces fell the foremost
soldiers, their gallant leader shot through and
through, plunging headlong, yet in his dying
agony waving his surviving men to get to
cover. Vengefully now the &#8220;Krags&#8221; opened
in reply to Remington and Mauser. The blue-shirts
struggled on inch by inch through the
network of bamboo. Still the storm swept up
the roadway, and no man could hope to face it
and live. But, little by little, the low-aimed,
steady volleys, driven in by squad and section
through the canebreak, or by company and platoon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
across the westward swamps, told on the
nerve and discipline of the little brown men in
the bamboo. Their shots flew swift, but wild
and higher. Then a daring lad, in the rough
field uniform of a subaltern of infantry, sprang
like a cat into the fire-flashing lane, and, revolver
in hand and a squad of devoted fellows at
his heels, dashed straight at the wooden walls
ahead. In frantic haste the occupants blazed
shot after shot upon him and his heroic followers.
One after another three went down;
but, in another instant, the lieutenant leading,
they reached the block house and darted
through the open doorway, the last of its garrison
fleeing in panic before such unheard-of
daring and determination. And then came the
rush of comrades cheering down the lane, tumbling
over the earthworks and the luckless
gang that, still crouching there, held to their
position, and all the southward leading road
was ours.
</p>
<p>But, over along the next lane, a parallel
track through the timber, there had been as
stern a check; and the fury of the fire from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
trenches in the thickets forced brave men to
cover and dropped others in their tracks. &#8220;By
God, we must have it!&#8221; almost screamed a tall
captain, pointing with his sword to the flashing
block house half hidden in the trees. &#8220;Hear
those fellows on the other road? Don&#8217;t let them
beat us. Come on, lads!&#8221; and out he darted
into the open, an instant target for a score of
Mausers. Out, too, leaped half a dozen men,
one a tall, lithe, superbly built young athlete,
with a face aflame with resolution and rage of
battle. Out leaped Billy Gray from the corner
of the cross-road, and, cheering madly, called
on others to follow. Down went the captain,
shot through the knee. Down went the nearmost
man, the tall youth who was first to follow.
Down went a brawny sergeant, who had
stopped to raise his fallen captain; but on swept
a score of others while the bamboos blazed with
the fierce volleying of the Krags. Forward in
scores now, yelling like Apaches, rushed the
regulars; and somehow, he never just knew
how it happened, Gray found himself a moment
later straddling an old field gun in a whirl of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
dust and dirt and smoke and cheers, was conscious
of something wet and warm streaming
down his side, and of being tenderly lifted from
his perch by brawny, blue-sleeved arms, given
a sip from a canteen, and then, half-led, half-supported
back to where the surgeon was
already kneeling by the tall young soldier on
whose brow the last dew was settling, on whose
fine, clear-cut face the shadow of the death
angel&#8217;s wings was already traced. The poor
fellow&#8217;s eyes opened wearily as he sipped the
stimulant pressed upon him by eager, sympathetic
hands, and glanced slowly about as
though in search of some familiar face; and so
they fell on those of Billy Gray, who, forgetful
for the moment of his own hurt, threw himself
by the stranger&#8217;s side and seized his clammy
hand. A half smile flitted over the pale face,
the other hand groped at the breast of his blue
shirt and slowly drew forth a packet, stained
and dripping with the blood that welled slowly
from a shothole in the broad white breast.
&#8220;Give to&mdash;General Drayton&mdash;Promise,&#8221; he
gasped, and pushed it painfully toward Billy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
Gray. Then the brave eyes closed, the weary
head fell back; and Gray, staring as though in
stupefaction into the placid face, found himself
drooping, too, growing dizzy and faint and
reeling, but still holding on to his trust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t some of you know him?&#8221; asked the
surgeon. &#8220;He&#8217;s past helping now, poor lad.
Here, you drink this, Billy;&#8221; and he placed a
little silver cup at Gray&#8217;s pallid lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He came a-runnin&#8217; from over at Block
House 12 with a note from division headquarters
just as we went in,&#8221; said a veteran sergeant,
drawing the back of a powder-stained
hand across his dripping forehead, then respectfully
stepping back as a young officer bent
down and glanced at Gray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Much hurt, Billy, old man? No? Thank
God for that! Look at who? Where? Why,
God of heaven, it&#8217;s Pat Latrobe! Oh, Pat!
Pat! dear old boy&mdash;has it come to this!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>

<p>In the fortnight of incessant action that followed
the mad attack of that starlit Sunday
morning there was no place for Billy Gray.
Sorely wounded, yet envied by many a fellow
soldier for the glowing words in which the
brigade commander praised his conduct and
urged his brevet, the boy had been carried back
to the great reserve hospital at Malate. The
breezy wards were filled with sick or wounded,
and certain of the rooms of the old convent
once used for study and recitation had been set
apart for officers. There were three cots in the
one to which they bore him, and two were
already occupied. Even in his pain and weakness
he could hardly suppress a cry of dismay;
for there, with his arm bandaged and in splints,
his face white from loss of blood, his eyes closed
in the sleep of utter exhaustion, lay Stanley
Armstrong. Time and again the boy&#8217;s heart
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
and conscience had rebuked him for the
estrangement that had arisen between him and
this man who had proved his best friend.
Time and again he had promised himself that
he would strive to win back that friendship; but
well he knew that first he must reinstate himself
in Armstrong&#8217;s respect; and how could he
hope for that so long as he surrendered to the
fascinations that kept him dangling about the
dainty skirts of Witchie Garrison? Oddly
enough the boy had hardly bothered his head
with any thought of what Frank Garrison
might think of his attentions or devotions,
whatever they could be called, to this very captivating
and capricious helpmate. When a
husband is so overwhelmed with other cares or
considerations that he never sees his wife from
morn till night, society seems to correspondingly
lose sight of him. Down in the depths of his
heart the boy was ashamed of himself. He never
heard Armstrong mentioned that he did not
wince. He knew and she knew that, coming
suddenly upon them as Armstrong had that
tropic night on the Queen, he must have heard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
her words, must have realized that some compact
or understanding existed between them,
which neither Gray nor Mrs. Frank could palliate
or explain. It had not needed that episode
to tell her that Armstrong held her in contempt;
and yet, when they chanced to meet, she
could smile up into his eyes as beamingly, as
guilelessly, as though no shadow of sin had ever
darkened her winsome face. But not so Gray.
He moaned in secret over the loss of a strong
man&#8217;s confidence and esteem. He longed to
find a way to win it back. He had even
thought to go to the colonel with his trouble,
make a clean breast of it, tell him the truth&mdash;that
he had fallen deeply, as it was possible for
him to fall, in love with Amy Lawrence; had
hoped his love was returned; had found it was
not&mdash;that she had only a frank, friendly, kindly
interest in him; and that, wounded and stung,
he had fretted himself into a fever at Honolulu,
aided by Canker&#8217;s aspersions, and then&mdash;well&mdash;any
man is liable, said Billy to himself, to
get smitten with a woman who tenderly and
skillfully nurses him day after day; and that&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
just what Witchie Garrison did. But somehow
the opportunity to tell him never seemed
to come; and now, now that Armstrong and
himself were thus thrown together with the
prospect of being in the same room day and
night for the best of the month, a third officer,
a stranger, lay there, too, and in his presence
or hearing any confidences would be impossible,
even if Armstrong encouraged them, which he
probably would not. In this embarrassment
Billy&#8217;s wish was that the colonel were fifty
miles away. It was fate and a hard one,
thought he, that brought him there&mdash;an ever-present
reproach. It was luck of the worst
kind that they should be confronted under such
circumstances, since neither could retreat. He
submitted in anxious silence to the keen, quick
examination of the skillful surgeon in charge
and to the re-dressing of his wound. He could
have been proud and happy but for that shadow
on his life, of which Armstrong&#8217;s presence would
so constantly remind him. He could not even
think how his dear old dragoon daddy would
rejoice in the congratulations that would surely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
greet him when the story of the brave dash of
the &mdash;teenth, Billy among the foremost, should
reach the States. He could not even dream how
it might affect her&mdash;Amy Lawrence. He was
beginning to be ashamed now in this presence
to think how that other&mdash;how Margaret Garrison
might be impressed, forgetting that, to the
army girl who has lived long years on the
frontier, tales of heroism are the rule, not the
exception. He wondered how long it could be
before she would come to him to bring him
comfort. Surely by this time she knew that
he had been seriously, painfully wounded. He
did not know, however, that at the very first
sound of battle Frost had bundled the sisters
aboard his launch and steamed away to the
transports. Yet, what comfort could her visit
bring to him with that stern censor lying there,
seeing and hearing all? Billy Gray that Monday
night could almost have wished that Armstrong&#8217;s
slumber might be eternal, never
dreaming that before a second Monday should
come he would thank Heaven with grateful
heart for Armstrong&#8217;s presence, vigilance and
intervention.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>In three days the colonel was able to sit up.
Within the week he was permitted to take air
and exercise in the spacious court of the old
college, his sword arm in its sling. But Gray
and the young officer of volunteers were too
seriously wounded to leave their pillows. The &mdash;teenth
had occupied a new line far south of
the old one; but, one at a time, several of Billy&#8217;s
brother officers had dropped in to see him and
tell him regimental news; and one of them, the
young West Pointer who had broken down at
sight of the dying face that stirring Sunday
morning, told him of Latrobe&#8217;s soldier funeral
and of General Drayton&#8217;s presence and speechless
grief; and Billy&#8217;s hand groped beneath the
pillow for that little blood-stained packet still
undelivered. He had promptly caused the information
to be conveyed to the veteran commander
that it was his own lost nephew who
had died his soldier death in front of the firing
line; but the packet still remained in his hands;
and even before the tiny thermometer confirmed
his views, the keen eye of the surgeon saw that
something had heightened Billy&#8217;s fever that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
day; and so, when just at sunset there came
driving into the court the most stylish equipage
in all Manila, and Mrs. Garrison fluttered up
the broad stairway and confidently asked to be
announced to Mr. Gray, the steward in charge
of the floor was very, very sorry, but&mdash;the doctor
had given instructions that no more visitors
should see the young gentleman that day.
Mrs. Frank smiled indulgently, and asked for
the doctor himself, and beamed on him with all
her witchery and begged for just a few words;
but the suave, placid, yet implacable doctor said
he, too, was sorry&mdash;sorry that Mr. Gray was
not able to see any one else, but such was the
case. Mrs. Garrison said she thought if Mr.
Gray knew that it was&mdash;but perhaps Dr. Frank
didn&#8217;t know it was she who had nursed Mr.
Gray so assiduously at Honolulu. Dr. Frank
did know that and more; but he did not say so;
neither did he yield. There were tears in her
eyes as she sprang into her carriage again; but
they were tears of anger and defeat. She
dashed them away the very next instant and
smiled joy and congratulation, even adulation,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
at sight of the tall, stalwart officer, his arm in
a sling, who stood the center of a staring group
as her carriage flashed by. She would have
ordered stop; but while the rest of the party
had gazed as they lifted their caps, Armstrong&#8217;s
uninjured hand performed its duty, his cap had
been lifted with the others, but not so much as
a glance went her way; and Margaret Garrison,
bitter in spirit, drove on down past the old
cuartel to her luxurious quarters where Nita,
a piteous shadow of the &#8220;sweet girl graduate&#8221;
of the year before, was awaiting her coming.
With the Insurgents&#8217; retreat and the advance
of the American lines there had been a gradual
return of the refugees among the transports; and
Frost had finally brought his birdling back to
shore; but Nita dare not drive, she said, for
fear of again seeing those stern, reproachful
eyes. The guard at the gate had received orders
to admit no more of the rank and file, even
when they came as messengers; and so the child
was safe, said Margaret. As for herself, she
<i>must</i> drive, she <i>must</i> see Will Gray.
</p>
<p>But the instant she re-entered the house Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
Garrison knew that during her brief absence
some new trouble had come. Good heavens,
could she never leave Nita&#8217;s side that harm did
not befall her! At the head of the broad flight
of stairs stood her brother-in-law, a black frown
on his brow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go in and do what you can for her,&#8221; he
briefly said. &#8220;I thought&mdash;she&#8217;d be glad to
know that&mdash;that&mdash;fellow would trouble her no
more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow?&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean&mdash;Yes&mdash;Latrobe&mdash;killed and buried
a whole week ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you told <i>her</i>!&#8221; she cried, clinching her
little hands in impotent wrath. &#8220;You&mdash;brute!&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Another week rolled by. The tide of battle
had swept inland and northward; and all eyes
were on the plucky advance of MacArthur&#8217;s
strong division, while far out to the south and
east the thinned and depleted lines of Anderson
held an insurgent force that forever menaced
but dare not attack. The Primeval Dudes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
sorely missing their calmly energetic colonel,
had drifted into a war of words with their
nearest neighbors on the firing line, a far Western
regiment gifted with great command of
language and small regard for style. The latter
had crowed mightily over their more rigorously
disciplined comrades because of the compliments
bestowed on them in an official report,
wherein the Dudes received only honorable
mention. It was Captain Stricker of the volunteers who
had led the dash on the rebel
works across the Tripa to the left of Blockhouse
12. It was their Sergeant Finney who whacked
a Filipino major with the butt of his Springfield,
and tumbled out of him the batch of reports
and records that gave the numbers and
positions of every unit of Pilar&#8217;s division on
the southward zone. It was their Corporal
Norton who got the Mauser through the
shoulder just as, foremost in the rush, he bayoneted
the last Tagal at the Krupp guns in the
river redoubt. It was his devoted bunky, Private
Latrobe, who volunteered to carry the
division commander&#8217;s dispatch across the open
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
rice field and the yawning ditches that separated
the staff from the rest of the charging &mdash;teenth,
and who died gloriously in the rush on
the rebel works. Man after man of the woolly
Westerners had been referred to by name while,
but the Dudes had nothing to show but their
wounded colonel&#8217;s modest report that &#8220;where
every officer and man appeared to do his whole
duty it would be unjust to make especial mention
of even a limited few.&#8221; The Dudes were
getting hot over the taunts of the &#8220;Toughs,&#8221; as
some one had misnamed their neighbors; and
one night when there was more or less interchange
of pointed chaff in lieu of fight with a
common foe, there was heard a shrill voice
from the flank of the rifle pit nearest the Westerners,
and what it said was repeated in wonderment
over the brigade before the Dudes were
another day older.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dash your thievin&#8217; gang! We made
our record for ourselves anyhow. We didn&#8217;t
have to rely on any dashed deserters from the
regulars&mdash;as you did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And that was why Sergeant Sterne, of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
Dudes, was sent for by the field officers of both
regiments the following morning and bidden to
explain, which he did in few words. He was
ready to swear that the wounded Corporal Norton
was the very same young man he saw in
the adjutant&#8217;s office of the &mdash;teenth Regulars at
Camp Merritt, and was then called Morton.
And that evening the veteran sergeant major of
the &mdash;teenth was bidden to report at the reserve
hospital in Ermita, close to the Malate line, was
conducted to the bedside of a pallid young
soldier whose ticket bore the name of Norton,
and was asked to tell whether he had ever seen
him before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have, sir,&#8221; said the veteran, sadly and
gravely. &#8220;He is a deserter from the &mdash;teenth.
His name on our rolls was Morton.&#8221; And that
night Colonel Armstrong cabled to &#8220;Primate,&#8221;
New York, the single word &#8220;Found.&#8221; Nor
was it likely the lad would soon be lost again,
for a sentry with fixed bayonet stood within
ten feet of his bed with orders not to let him
out of his sight a second.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Garrison appeared at the hospital that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
very evening and heard of the episode, and
reached Billy Gray&#8217;s bedside looking harassed,
even haggard. During the past three days she
had been accorded admission, for Gray was so
much improved there was no reason to longer
forbid; but on each occasion the wounded volunteer
officer and the brace of attendants
present had precluded all possibility of confidential
talk. She must bide her time. Gray
would be up in a few days, said the doctor; and
then nothing would do, said Mrs. Garrison, but
he must be moved to their big, roomy, lovely
house on the bay side, and be made strong and
well again&mdash;made to give up those letters, too,
thought she; for she had wormed it out of a bystander
that a packet of some kind had been
given by the dying soldier to the lieutenant,
and she well knew what it must be. She had
even penned him a little note, since not a
whisper could be safely exchanged, and headed
it &#8220;Give this back to me the moment you have
read it.&#8221; In it she reminded him of his promise,
and&mdash;did he need to be reminded of hers?
She knew that packet of Nita&#8217;s letters had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
intrusted to his care. She assured him she had
it straight from the surgeon who attended both
Latrobe and himself, and they must reach the
hands of no man on earth, but must come to
her. Would he not give them at once or tell
her where she could find them?
</p>
<p>He gave back the note, but closed his eyes
and turned away. In the presence of Armstrong
day after day, and in the recollection of
Latrobe&#8217;s dying face and the last parting touch
of his stricken hand, Gray&#8217;s eyes were opening
to his own deplorable weakness. She plainly
saw her power was going, if not gone. He had
wrapped a silk handkerchief about the packet
and still kept it, with his watch and purse beneath
his pillow. He would not tell her where
it lay. She smiled archly for the benefit of the
attendant; but her eyes again eagerly claimed
a look from his, her lips framed the word &#8220;to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But neither on that morrow nor yet the next
day came her opportunity. The gallant fellow
who had lain there for days, dumb and patient,
but a barrier to her plans, had taken a turn for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
the worse, and she was again denied admission.
Then came the tidings that the barrier was removed,
the long fight was over; and the heartless
woman actually rejoiced. Now at last she
could talk to Will Gray; and when midnight
came she knew that now at last she must, for
Frank Garrison, worn and weary, returning
late from the front, briefly announced that
General Drayton purposed visiting the hospital
the following afternoon, and long before noon&mdash;long
before visiting hours, in fact, she was
there with flowers as winsome as her smile, and
some jelly as dainty as her own fair hands.
She was there, and the instant the hour sounded
was ushered in, and Billy Gray, propped on his
pillows, was writing to his father, and alone.
No time was to be lost. Any moment the attendant
might return. She threw herself on
her knees beside the homely, narrow cot, seized
his hand in hers, and looked him in the face.
&#8220;Where are they, Will?&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;Quick!
I must have them now!&#8221; But well she realized
that the spell was broken&mdash;that the old fascination
had died its death. Then it was useless
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
to hint at love; and in a torrent of impassioned
words she bade him think of all he owed
her, appealed to his sense of gratitude and
honor, and there, too, failed, for, admitting all
she claimed, he clumsily, haltingly, yet honestly
told her he saw now that it was all for an
object, all done in the hope that he might become
her instrument for the recovery of those
compromising letters; and now that fate had
delivered them into his hands he was bound by
honor and his promise&mdash;unheard, unspoken perhaps,
but all the same his promise&mdash;to the dead
to give them to General Drayton.
</p>
<p>Then rising in fury and denunciation, she
played her last trump. Trembling from head
to foot, pale with baffled purpose and with
growing dread, she bent over him, both hands
clinched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mad fool!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Do you know
what I can do&mdash;will do&mdash;unless you give them
to me here and now? As God hears me, Will
Gray, I will give that other packet to General
Drayton myself and swear that Colonel Canker
was right&mdash;that you <i>were</i> the thief he thought
you, and that I got those letters from you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>For a moment she stood there, menacing, at
his bedside, looking down in almost malignant
triumph on his amazed and incredulous face;
and then, with an awful fear checking the beat
of her heart and turning her veins to ice, she
grasped at the flimsy framework that supported
the netting over the cot, and stood swaying and
staggering, her eyes fixed in terror on the man
in the uniform of a colonel, who, quietly entering,
stood between her and the door, two papers
in his half-extended hand&mdash;a man whose voice,
long and too well known, cut her to the very
quick as she heard, in calm and measured tone
the words:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Garrison, here are two reasons why
you will do nothing of the kind. Shall I hand
these to General Drayton&mdash;or to your husband?&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p>The long wait for the coming of the big
transports with the regulars was over. For the
first time in history America was sending her
soldiery past the pyramids and through the
Indian sea, landing them, after forty days and
nights of voyaging, upon the low, flat shores
that hem Manila Bay, and shoving them out
to the hostile front before their sea-legs could
reach the swing and stride of the marching
step; yet, to all appearance, as unconcernedly at
home as though they had been campaigning in
the Philippines since the date of their enlistment.
This, to be sure, in the case of more
than half their number, would have given them
scant time in which to look about them, since
raw recruits were more numerous than seasoned
men. But no matter what may be his
lack of drill or preparation the average Anglo-Saxon
never seems to know the time when he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
doesn&#8217;t know how to fight. So, with all the
easy assurance of a veteran, our Yankee &#8220;Tommies&#8221;
wriggled into their blanket rolls and
trudged away to the posts assigned them; and
once more the army assumed the aggressive.
</p>
<p>There were changes in the composition of the
forces even before the move began. The Dudes
and the &#8220;Toughs&#8221; parted company; and the
former, with Stanley Armstrong once more
riding silent at their head, joined forces with
Stewart&#8217;s riddled regiment up the railway
toward Malolos. Colonel Frost had succeeded
in convincing the surgeons that he would be
as out of place as his name itself in such
a clime and climate, and was in daily expectation
of an order home. Billy Gray, mending
only slowly, had been sent to Corregidor,
where the bracing breezes of the China
Sea drove their tonic forces through his lungs
and veins, and the faintly rising hue of coming
health back into his hollow cheeks. The boy
had been harder hit than seemed the case at
first, said the fellows of the &mdash;teenth; but the
wise young surgeon of the &#8220;Second Reserve&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
and a grave-faced colonel of infantry could have
told of causes little dreamed of in the regiment&mdash;were
either given to telling the half of what
he knew.
</p>
<p>That something most unusual had occurred
in the room of Mr. Gray the day that the sad-faced,
kind old general visited the hospital at
least half a dozen patients could have told; for
an attendant went running for one of the women
nurses, and the doctor himself hurried to
the scene. It was on his arm that, half an
hour later, Mrs. Garrison slowly descended the
stairs, her flimsy white veil down, and silently
bowed her thanks and adieux as the doctor
closed the door of her carriage and nodded to
the little coachman. It was the doctor who
suggested to Colonel Frost that Manila air was
not conducive to his wife&#8217;s recovery, and recommended
Nagasaki as the place for her recuperation
until he could join her and take her
home. The Esmeralda bore the White Sisters
over Hongkong way within a week; and they
left without flourish of trumpet, with hardly
the flutter of a handkerchief; for, since the battle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
of the 5th of February, neither had been
seen upon the Luneta. Their women friends
were very few; the men they knew were mainly
at the front. The story got out somehow that
Garrison had asked to be relieved from further
duty as aide-de-camp, and returned to duty with
his regiment, and that Drayton would not have
it. The General&#8217;s manner toward that hard-working
staff officer, though often preoccupied
as of old, grew even kinder. He did not see
the sisters off for China, he was &#8220;far too busy&#8221;
was the explanation; but he offered Garrison a
fortnight&#8217;s leave, and urged his taking it, and
was obviously troubled when Garrison declined.
&#8220;You need rest and the change of air more
than any man I know,&#8221; said he; but Garrison
replied that change of scene and air would not
help him.
</p>
<p>There were two young fellows in khaki uniforms
landed from the hospital launch on the
back trip from Corregidor one warm March
day. One wore the badge of a subaltern of the &mdash;teenth
Regulars, the other the chevrons of a
corporal and the hatband of a famous fighting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
regiment of volunteers; yet the same carriage
bore them swiftly through the sentineled streets
of the walled city, and the guards at the Ayuntamiento
sprang to their arms and formed ranks
at sight of it, then dispersed at the low-toned
order of its commander when it was seen that,
instead of stopping at the curb and discharging
an elderly general officer, it whirled straight by
and held two youths in field uniform.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of &#8217;em&#8217;s young Gray, of the &mdash;teenth;
he that was hit in the charge on the Pasay
road,&#8221; said the officer of the guard to a comrade.
&#8220;But who the devil&#8217;s the other? He had
corporal&#8217;s chevrons on. Some fellow just got
a commission, perhaps.&#8221; And that was the
only way the soldier could account for a corporal
riding with a commissioned officer in a general&#8217;s
carriage. They had a long whirl ahead
of them, these two; and the corporal told Gray,
as he already had the General and Colonel
Armstrong, much of the story of his friendship
for &#8220;Pat&#8221; Latrobe, of that poor fellow&#8217;s illness
at San Francisco, and all the trouble it cost his
friend and chum. There was a strong bond
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
between them, he explained; and the blush of
shame that stole up in the face of the narrator
found instant answer in that of Billy Gray.
Determined to see service at the front and not
return to punishment in his regiment, never
dreaming that, in quitting a corps doomed apparently
to inaction at home, and joining one
going straight to the enemy&#8217;s country, he was
committing the grave crime of desertion,
&#8220;Gov.&#8221; Prime had spoken to some men in
Stewart&#8217;s regiment and was bidden to come
along and fetch his friend; for they were just as
ignorant as he. Having still considerable
money &#8220;Gov.&#8221; had bought civilian clothes, and
all the supplies they needed while about town,
and hired a boat that rowed them, with certain
items contraband of war, to the dark side of
the transport as nightfall came; and they were
easily smuggled aboard and into uniform, and
then, during the few days&#8217; stay at Honolulu,
were formally enlisted and no embarrassing
questions asked.
</p>
<p>And now poor Pat was gone and Prime&#8217;s
father had been cabling for him to return home;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
but there was that awkward matter about the
desertion. General Drayton was trying to have
it straightened out at Washington; for he had
been kindness itself the day of his visit to the
hospital, where almost his first act had been to
seek out the wounded young soldier who had
been his beloved nephew&#8217;s boon companion, and
at one time sole support. The sentry was relieved
of his surveillance, and Corporal Norton
transferred to Corregidor to recuperate; and
now that both lads were well on the road to
recovery, Drayton had sent for them. Strictly
speaking, some one should have seen to it that
Corporal Norton of the Volunteers was shifted
back to Private Norton of the &mdash;teenth, and the
chevrons stripped from his sleeves; but no one
had cared to interfere where the worsted was
concerned, especially as the boy had won such
praise for bravery at Concordia Bridge. So
there the chevrons stood when the two were
ushered into the presence of the gray-haired
chief; and he arose, and stepping forward, held
out a hand to each.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you, boys,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to be ready to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
take the next transport home. The doctors say
you need a sea voyage, Gray; so there is the
order. The doctors say your father needs you,
Prime; and the record will be duly straightened
out in Washington&mdash;the charge of desertion, no
doubt, will be removed. It&#8217;s a matter of influence.
To-night you dine with me here; and I
have asked your good friend, Colonel Armstrong,
to come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the blood rose guiltily to Billy&#8217;s
cheek. Not yet had he made his peace with
his conscience, and that valued counselor and
invaluable friend from whose good graces he
seemed to have fallen entirely. Not once had
opportunity been afforded in which to speak
and open his heart to him. As for writing,
that seemed impossible. Billy could handle
almost any implement better than a pen. But
even in the few minutes left him in which to
think he knew that now at least he must &#8220;face
the music,&#8221; like the man his father would have
him be, even though it took more nerve than
did that perilous dash on the Tagal works that
Sunday morning. Billy would rather do that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
twice over than have to face Armstrong&#8217;s stern,
searching eyes, and hear again the cold, almost
contemptuous tone in which the colonel said to
him the day the doctor led his vanquished and
hysterical charmer from the room: &#8220;Don&#8217;t try
to thank, man, try to <i>think</i> what you risk&mdash;what
you deserve to lose&mdash;for putting yourself
in the power of such a woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From that day until this, here on the banks
of the swift-running Pasig, they had not met at
all; and it seemed to Gray as though Armstrong
had aged a year. There was a lump in
his throat as he went straight up to the colonel,
his blue eyes never flinching, though they
seemed to fill, and bravely spoke. &#8220;Colonel
Armstrong, I have an explanation that I owe to
you. Will you give me a few minutes on the
gallery?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Gray,&#8221; was the calm reply; and
the youngster led the way.
</p>
<p>It was a broken story. It told of his desperation
and misery through Canker&#8217;s persecution,
of his severe illness, then of the utter weakness
and prostration; then <i>her</i> coming, and with her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
comfort, peace, reassurance, gradual return to
health, and with that, gradual surrender to
his nurse&#8217;s fascinations. Then her demand
upon him, her plea, her final insistence that he
should prove his gratitude and devotion by
getting for her those dangerous letters, and his
weakness in letting her believe he could and
would do so. That was the situation when
they went on to Manila; and Armstrong knew
the rest&mdash;knew that but for his timely aid she
might have triumphed over his repentance; but
Armstrong had come, had vanquished her and
poor Latrobe&#8217;s last wishes were observed. The
fateful packet containing the three letters that
were most important was placed in his uncle&#8217;s
trembling hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how was it&mdash;what was it that so utterly
crushed her?&#8221; asked Billy, when the colonel
had once more extended his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The evidences of her own forgery, her own
guilt,&#8221; said Armstrong gravely. &#8220;One was
the order she wrote in excellent imitation of
her husband&#8217;s hand and signature, authorizing
the changing of guard arrangements on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
wharf the evening Stewart sailed. The other
was a note in pencil, also purporting to come
from him, directing old Keeny&mdash;you remember
the General&#8217;s Irish orderly&mdash;to search for a
packet of letters that had come by mail, and
must be in the general&#8217;s tent, either about his
desk or overcoat, and to bring them at once to
room number so and so at the Palace. Of
course neither the General nor Garrison was
there when he arrived with them; but she was,
and with all her fascinations. She got the Irishman
half drunk and told him a piteous story
and made him swear he&#8217;d never tell the General
or anybody. If questioned he could plead
he had gone out, and&mdash;&#8220;got a little full with the
boys.&#8221; She gave him money&mdash;a big bit, too;
and he got more than full. &#8220;The very vehemence
of his denials made me suspect him,&#8221;
said Armstrong; &#8220;but he was firm when examined.&#8221;
The General never required him to remain
at the tent at night. He could go to town
any evening he wished; and to cover his appearing
at the Palace where the General long
had a room, and where he was well known, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
could say he was only in to have a word with
one of the housemaids, and to give Mrs. Garrison
a handkerchief one of the ladies must have
dropped. But one thing she failed in&mdash;getting
the letter back. Keeny had left it at camp in
the pocket of his old blouse, and when he sobered
up and all the questions were asked he hung
onto it in case the truth came out, in order that
he might save himself from punishment. But
it broke him&mdash;he got to drinking oftener, and
the General had to send him to his regiment;
and then when we heard of Canker&#8217;s charge
against you I saw the way to wring the truth
out of him. He worshiped your father, as did
every Irish dragoon that ever rode under him,
and I told him you were to be brought to trial
for the crime. Then he broke down and gave
the truth&mdash;and her penciled order&mdash;to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the silence that followed the soldier of
forty and the lad of only twenty-one sat looking
gravely into each other&#8217;s face. It was
Armstrong who spoke again:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gray, it was manly in you to tell me your
story and your trouble. I could help you here;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
but&mdash;who can help you when you have to tell
it&mdash;next time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time?&mdash;father, do you mean?&#8221; queried
Gray, a puzzled look in his blue eyes. &#8220;I
hadn&#8217;t thought, do you know, to worry dear
old dad&mdash;unless he asked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Armstrong&#8217;s grave face grew dark: &#8220;You
ought to know what I mean, Gray. This story
may come up when least you think for, and&mdash;would
you have it told Miss Lawrence before
she hears it from you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Lawrence,&#8221; answered Billy, flushing,
&#8220;isn&#8217;t in the least interested.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you are not&mdash;that you
were not engaged to her?&#8221; The colonel had
been gazing out over the swirling river; but
now, with curious contraction of brows, with a
strong light in his eyes, he had turned full on
the young officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Engaged to her! Do you suppose I could
have been&mdash;been such an ass if <i>she</i> would have
had me? No! She&mdash;she had too much sense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was full a minute before Armstrong spoke
again. For a few seconds he sat motionless,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
gazing steadily into Gray&#8217;s handsome, blushing
face; then he turned once more and looked out
over the Pasig and the scarred level of the rice
fields beyond. And the long slant of the sunshine
on distant towers and neighboring roofs
and copse and wall, and the unlovely landscape
seemed all tinged with purple haze and tipped
with gold. The blare of a bugle summoning
the men to supper seemed softened by distance,
or some new, strange intonation, and gave to
the ugliest of all our service calls the effect of
soft, sweet melody; and there was sympathy
and genuine feeling in the deep voice as he
once again held out his hand to Billy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me, lad, for I judged you more
harshly than you deserved.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One lovely, summer-like evening, some five
weeks later, in long, heaving surges the deep
blue waves of the Pacific came lazily rolling
toward the palm-bordered beach at Waikiki,
bursting into snowy foam on the pebbly strand,
and, softly hissing, swept like fleecy mantle up
the slope of wet, hard-beaten sand, then broke,
lapping and whirling, about the stone supports
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
of the broad <i>lanai</i> of one of the many luxurious
homes that dot the curving line of the bay to the
east of Honolulu. Dimly outlined in the fairy
moonlight, the shadowy mountains of the Waianai
Range lay low upon the western horizon.
Eastward the bare, bold volcanic upheaval of
Diamond Head gleamed in bold relief, reflecting
the silver rays. Here and there through
the foliage shone the soft-colored fires of Chinese
lanterns, and farther away, along the concave
shore, distant electric lights twinkled like
answering signals to the stars in the vault of
blue, and the &#8220;riding lights&#8221; of the few transports
or warships, swinging at anchor on the
tide.
</p>
<p>From a little grove of palms close to the low
sea wall came the soft tinkle of guitar, and now
and then a burst of joyous song, while under
the spreading roof of the broad portico or <i>lanai</i>,
the murmur of voices, the occasional ripple of
musical laughter, the floating haze of cigarette
smoke, told where a party of worshipers were
gathered, rejoicing in the loveliness of nature
and the night.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></p>
<p>It was a reunited party, too, and in the welcome
of their winsome hostess, in the soft,
soothing influence of that summer clime, and
through the healing tonic of the long sea voyage,
faces that had been saddened by deep anxiety
but a few weeks gone, smiled gladness into
one another now. A tall, gray-haired man reclined
in an easy lounging chair, his eyes intent
on the clear-cut face of a young soldier in trim
white uniform who, with much animation, was
telling of an event in the recent campaign. By
his side, her humid eyes following his every
gesture, sat a tall, dark, stylish girl, whose hand
from time to time crept forth to caress his&mdash;an
evident case of sister worship. Close at hand
another young fellow, in spotless white, his
curly head bent far forward, his elbows on his
knees, his fingertips joining, was studying silently
the effect of his comrade&#8217;s story on another&mdash;a
fair girl whose sweet face, serene and
composed, was fully illumined by the silvery
light of the unclouded moon. &#8220;Coming by
transport, via Honolulu&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Gov.&#8217;s&#8221; cabled
message had brought father and sister to meet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
him at these famed &#8220;Cross-roads of the Pacific,&#8221;
and whither they journeyed Amy Lawrence,
too, must go, said they; and, glad of opportunity
to see the land of perennial bloom and
sunshine, and wearied with long, long months
of labor in the service of the Red Cross, the girl
had willingly accepted their invitation. Coaled
and provisioned the transport had pushed on
for the seven-day run for San Francisco; but
the recovering of his long-lost son and the soft,
reposeful atmosphere of the lovely, yet isolated
island group, had so benefited Mr. Prime that
in family council it had been decided wise for
them to spend a week or ten days longer at the
Royal Hawaiian; and the boys had found no
difficulty in &#8220;holding over&#8221; for the Sedgwick
that followed swift upon the heels of their own
ship. Five joyous days had they together, and
this, the fifth, had been spent in sightseeing
beyond the lofty Pali of the northward side.
The &#8220;O. &amp; O.&#8221; liner was coming in from Yokohama
even as they drove away; and as they
sat at dinner on the open <i>lanai</i>, long hours
later, it had been mentioned by their host that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
the Sedgwick, too, had reached the harbor during
the afternoon, and that army people were
passengers on both liner and transport. Billy
Gray, for one, began to wish that dinner were
over. He was eager to get the latest news from
the Philippines, and the Sedgwick left Manila
full a week behind their slower craft.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear who came with her?&#8221; he
somewhat eagerly asked, &#8220;or on the Doric?&#8221;
he continued, with less enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not,&#8221; was the answer&mdash;&#8220;that is, on
the Sedgwick;&#8221; and the gentleman baited lamely
and glanced furtively and appealingly at his
wife. There was that embarrassing, interrogative
silence that makes one feel the futility of
concealment. It was Miss Lawrence who
quickly came to his relief and dispelled the
strain on the situation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should fancy very few army people would
choose that roundabout way from Manila when
they can come direct by transport, and have
the ship to themselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;er&mdash;yes; certainly, certainly,&#8221; answered
the helpless master of the house, dodging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
now the warning and reproach in the eyes
of his wiser mate at the other end of the table.
The crack of a coachman&#8217;s whip and the swift
beat of trotting hoofs on the graveled road in
front could be heard as he faltered on. The
gleam of cab lights came floating through the
northward shrubbery. &#8220;Except, of course,
when they happen to be&mdash;er&mdash;already, well, you
know, at Hongkong or Nagasaki,&#8221; he lamely
concluded.
</p>
<p>There was an instant hurried glance exchanged
between Gray and Prime. Then up
spoke in silvery tone their hostess:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Other officers, you know, are ordered home.
We have just heard to-day that Colonel Frost
comes very soon. His health seems quite shattered.
I believe&mdash;you knew&mdash;of them&mdash;slightly
that is to say, Miss Prime, did you not?&#8221; But
even with her words she cast an anxious, furtive
glance along the dim reach of the <i>lanai</i>, for
the pit-a-pat of footfalls, the swish of feminine
draperies was distinctly heard. Two dainty,
white-robed forms came floating into view, and,
with changing color, their hostess suddenly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
arose and stepped forward to meet them. Just
one second of silence intervened, then, all grace
and gladness, smiles and cordiality, both
her little hands outstretched, Mrs. Frank
Garrison came dancing into their midst, her sister
more timidly following.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Dear</i> Mrs. Marsden, how perfectly (kiss,
kiss) delicious! Yes, this is the baby sister
I&#8217;ve raved to you about. We go right on with
the Doric; but I <i>had</i> to bring her out with me
that you might have just one glance at her.
Why! Mr. Prime! Why, what could be more
charming than to find you here? And &#8216;Gov.&#8217;
<i>too</i>&mdash;you wicked boy! What won&#8217;t I do to you
for never telling me you were in Manila? And
Mildred!&#8221; (kiss&mdash;kiss, despite a palpable dodge
and heightened color on part of the half-dazed
recipient). &#8220;And you, too, Miss Lawrence?&#8221;
(Both hands, but no kiss&mdash;one hand calmly accepted).
&#8220;Ah, then I know how happy <i>you</i> are,
Mr. Willie Gray!&#8221; (beaming arch smiles upon
that flushed and flustered young officer. Then,
turning again to twine a jeweled arm about
the slim waist of their hostess, to whom she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
clung as though defying any effort to dislodge,
yet pleading for protection): &#8220;Who on earth
could have foretold that we of all people should
have met out here&mdash;of all places? How long
did you say you had been here? A week?
And of course, dear Mrs. Marsden has done
everything to make it lovely for you. <i>I</i> should
have <i>died</i> without her.&#8221; And so the swift
play of words went on, the rapid fire of her fluent
tongue covering the movement of her allies
and drowning all possibility of reply. It was
an odd and trying moment. Mrs. Marsden,
well knowing, as who in Honolulu did not, of
Mrs. Frank&#8217;s devotion to the young lieutenant,
barely six months agone, was striving to welcome
the shrinking little scare-faced thing that
blindly and helplessly had drifted in in the
elder sister&#8217;s wake. The introductions that followed,
after the American fashion, were as perfunctory
as well-bred women can permit. The
greetings were almost solemn, smileless, and,
on part of Nita, fluttering to the verge of a
faint; and nothing but Witchie&#8217;s plucky and
persistent support, and the light flow of airy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
chat and laughter, carried her through the
ordeal. The two young soldiers stood stiffly
back, red-faced and black-browed; the father,
pallid and cold, could hardly force himself to
unbend, yet his lips mumbled the name &#8220;Mrs.
Frost,&#8221; as he bowed at presentation; Miss
Prime stood erect and trembling; Miss Lawrence,
with brave eyes but heightened color.
To leave at once was impossible; to remain was
more than embarrassment. Most gallantly did
they battle, Mrs. Marsden and Mrs. Frank, to
lift the wet blanket from the group and relieve
the strain. Reward came to crown their efforts
in strange, unlooked-for fashion. Hoofs, wheels
and flashing lights were again at the entrance
gate, even as Mrs. Frank, sparkling with animation,
distributing her gay good humor over
the silent semicircle, suddenly exclaimed: &#8220;Oh,
if I&#8217;d <i>only</i> known you were here, I could have
provided the one thing to make our reunion
complete! If we were not going on at daybreak
I should do it yet.&#8221; Then hoofs and wheels and
lights had come to a stop at the front of the
house, and in measured, martial tread a man&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
footsteps were heard upon the <i>lanai</i>. Then,
all of a sudden, with a cry of joy, Witchie
burst in again: &#8220;<i>Should</i> do it?&mdash;I shall do it!
Said I not I was the fairy queen? Behold me
summon my subjects from the ends of the obedient
earth!&#8221; And, waving her parasol as she
would a wand, gayly pirouetting as she had
that night in the tent at old Camp Merritt, she
danced forward: &#8220;Sound ye the trumpets,
slaves! Hail to the chief! See the conquering
hero comes! Enter Brevet Brigadier-General
Stanley Armstrong!&mdash;though his arm is anything
but strong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bowing gravely to the sprite in front of him,
vaguely to the group in the shaded light at the
edge of the <i>lanai</i>, and joyously to the little hostess,
as almost hysterically she sprang forward
and clasped his hands, the colonel of the Primeval
Dudes stood revealed before them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Colonel</i> Armstrong! How&mdash;when did you
get here? What does this mean? Is your arm
quite well again? Why <i>didn&#8217;t</i> you let us know
you were coming?&#8221; were the questions rained
upon him by Mrs. Marsden, immediately followed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
by the somewhat illogical statement that
she was actually breathless with surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I answer in their order?&#8221; said he,
smiling down at her flushed and joyous face.
&#8220;By the Sedgwick. This afternoon. That I
wished to see you. Doing quite well. Because
I didn&#8217;t know myself until two days before we
sailed.&#8221; Then, as he stood peering beyond her,
she would have turned him to her other guests
had not Mrs. Garrison made instant and impulsive
rush upon him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As fairy queen or fairy godmother I claim
first speech,&#8221; she gayly cried. &#8220;What tidings
of my liege lord, and where is hers, my fairy
sister&#8217;s?&#8221; she demanded, waving in front of
him her filmy parasol and pirouetting with
almost girlish grace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Garrison was looking fairly well
the day I sailed,&#8221; he answered briefly; &#8220;and
Colonel Frost left for Hongkong only a few
hours before in hopes, as we understood, of
finding Mrs. Frost at Yokohama. Permit
me,&#8221; he added, with grave courtesy. &#8220;I have
but little time as I transfer to the Doric to-night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></p>
<p>A shade spread over the radiant face one instant,
but was as quickly swept away. &#8220;And
I have not met your guests,&#8221; he finished, turning
to Mrs. Marsden, as he spoke, and quietly
passing Mrs. Garrison in so doing. The next
moment he was shaking hands with the entire
party, coming last of all to Amy Lawrence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They told me of your being here,&#8221; he said,
looking straight into her clear, beautiful eyes;
&#8220;and I thought I might find you at Mrs. Marsden&#8217;s.
She was our best friend when we were
in Honolulu. They told me, too, that you desired
to go by the Doric, but feared she would
be crowded,&#8221; he continued, turning to Mr.
Prime. &#8220;There is one vacant stateroom now;
its occupants have decided to stay over and
visit the islands. There will be, I think,
another.&#8221; And drawing a letter from an inner
pocket he calmly turned to Nita, now shrinking
almost fearfully behind her sister. &#8220;The
colonel gave this to me to hand to you, Mrs.
Frost, on the chance of your being here. He
will arrive by next week&#8217;s steamer, and, pardon
me, it is something I think you should see at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
once as a change in your plans may be necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was vain for Margaret to interpose. The
letter was safely lodged in her sister&#8217;s hands,
and with so significant a message that it had to
be opened and read without delay. Gayly excusing
herself, and with a low reverence and
comprehensive smile to the assembled party,
she ushered her sister into the long parlor, and
the curtain fell behind them. There followed
a few minutes of brisk conference upon the
<i>lanai</i>, the Marsdens pleading against, the
father and daughter for, immediate return to
the hotel, there to claim the vacated rooms
aboard the steamer. In the eager discussion,
pro and con, both young soldiers joined, both
saying &#8220;go,&#8221; and promising to follow by the
Sedgwick. In this family council, despite the
vivid interest Armstrong felt in the result,
neither Amy Lawrence nor himself took any
part. Side by side at the snowy railing over the
breaking sea they stood almost silent listeners.
Suddenly there came from the front again the
sound of hoofs and wheels, loud and distinct at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
the start, then rapidly dying away with the
increasing distance. Miss Lawrence turned
and looked inquiringly into the eyes she well
knew were fixed upon her. Mrs. Marsden
hesitated one moment, then stepped across the
<i>lanai</i>, peered into the parlor and entered. It
was a minute before she returned, and in that
minute the decisive vote was cast, the carriage
ordered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I ought to have known how it would
be if I left you a moment!&#8221; she cried despairingly,
on her reappearance, a little folded paper
in her hand. &#8220;But at least you must stay half
an hour. We can telephone direct to the dock
and secure the staterooms, if go you must on
the Doric. Yes,&#8221; she continued, lowering her
voice, &#8220;they are not going farther until Colonel
Frost comes. Mrs. Garrison explains that her
sister was really too ill and too weak to come
out here, but she thought the drive might do
her good. She thought best to slip quietly
away with her, and bids me say good-night to
you all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So, when next day the Doric sailed, four new
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
names appeared upon the passenger list, and
the last men down the stage already &#8220;trembling
on the rise,&#8221; were two young fellows in white
uniform, who turned as they sprang to the dock
and waved their jaunty caps. &#8220;Join you in
ten days at &#8217;Frisco!&#8221; shouted the shorter of
the two, gazing upward and backward at the
quartette on the promenade deck. &#8220;Oh! beg a
thousand pardons,&#8221; he added hastily, as he
bumped against some slender object, and,
wheeling about to pick up a flimsy white fan,
he found himself face to face with Witchie
Garrison, kerchief waving, beaming, smiling,
throwing kisses innumerable to the party he
had so lately left. The hot blood rushed to his
forehead, an angry light to his eyes, as she
nodded blithely, forbearingly, forgivingly at
him. &#8220;Dear boy,&#8221; she cried, in her clear,
penetrating treble, &#8220;how could you be expected
to see any one after leaving&mdash;her?&#8221; But
Gov.&#8217;s arm was linked in his at the very
instant and led him glowering away, leaving
her close to the edge of the crowded dock, smiling
sweetness, blessing and bliss upon a silent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
and unresponsive group, and waving kerchief
and kisses to them until, far from shore, the
Doric headed out to sea.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>They were nearing home again. Day and
night for nearly a week the good ship had borne
them steadily onward over a sea of deepest
blue, calm and unruffled as the light that shone
in Amy&#8217;s eyes. Hours of each twenty-four
Armstrong had been the constant companion,
at first of the trio, then of the two&mdash;for Mr.
Prime had found a kindred spirit in a veteran
merchant homeward bound from China&mdash;then
of one alone; for Miss Prime had found another
interest, and favor in the eyes of a young tourist
paying his first visit to our shores, and so it
happened that before the voyage, all too brief,
was half over, Amy Lawrence and Armstrong
walked the spacious deck for hours alone or sat
in sheltered nooks, gazing out upon the sea.
The soft, summer breezes of the first few days
had given place to keener, chillier air. The fog
ahead told of the close proximity of the Farallones.
Heavier wraps had replaced the soft
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
fabrics of the Hawaiian saunterings. But
warmth and gladness, coupled with a strange
new shyness in his presence, were glowing in
her fresh young heart. One day she had said
to him: &#8220;You have not told me how you came
to leave there&mdash;just now,&#8221; and it was a
moment before he answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the surgeons&#8217; doing. They sent
me back from the front because the wound did
not properly heal, and then ordered a sea voyage
until it did; but I turn back at once from
San Francisco.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was silent a few seconds. This was unlooked
for and unwelcome news. &#8220;I thought,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;at least Gov. heard Dr. Frank say it
would be four months before you could use that
arm.&#8221; She plucked at the fringe of the heavy
shawl he had wrapped about her as she reclined
in the low steamer chair; but the white
lids veiled her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; answered Armstrong; &#8220;but you
see I do not have to use it much at any time.
I&#8217;m all right otherwise, and there will soon be
need of me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></p>
<p>&#8220;More campaigning?&#8221; she anxiously inquired,
her eyes one moment uplifting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably. Those fellows have no idea of
quitting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Another interval of silence. The long, lazy,
rolling swell of the Pacific had changed during
the day to an abrupt and tumultuous upheaval
that tossed the Doric like a cork and made locomotion
a problem. The rising wind and sea
sent the spray whirling from her bows, and
Mildred&#8217;s young man, casting about for a dry
corner, had deposited his fair charge on a bench
along the forward deck house and was scouting
up and down for steamer chairs. Armstrong
had drawn his close to that in which Miss Lawrence
reclined, her knitted steamer cap pulled
well forward over her brow. His feet were
braced against a stanchion. His eyes were intent
upon her sweet face. He had no thought
for other men, even those in similar plight.
His gaze, though unhampered by the high peak
of his forage cap, comprehended nothing beyond
the rounded outline of that soft cheek. Her
eyes, well-nigh hidden by her shrouding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
&#8220;Tam,&#8221; saw the searching son of Albion and
told her his need. The best of women will find
excuse for interruption at such moments when
sure of the devotion of the man who sits with a
fateful question quivering on his lips; and, even
when she longs to hear those very words, will
find means to defer them as a kitten dallies with
a captured mouse or a child saves to the very
last the sweetest morsel of her birthday cake.
Not ten minutes before, when the Honorable
Bertie Shafto had started impulsively toward
the vacant chair by Armstrong&#8217;s side, a firm
hand detained him, and Miss Prime had hastily
interposed. &#8220;Not on any account!&#8221; said she,
imperiously. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see?&#8221; And Mr.
Shafto, adjusting his monocle, had gazed long
and fixedly, and then, transferring his gaze to
her, had said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&mdash;eh&mdash;yes. It&#8217;s not ours, I suppose you
mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But now Amy Lawrence was beckoning, and
he made a rush for the rail, then worked his
way aft, hand over hand. Every movable on
deck was taking a sudden slant to starboard,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
and the sea went hissing by almost on level
with the deck as next she spoke. &#8220;Surely a
soldier needs both arms in battle, and you&mdash;Oh,
certainly, Mr. Shafto, take that chair,&#8221;
she added. Armstrong glanced up suddenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! that you, Shafto? Yes; take it by all
means.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Anything, thought he, rather than that they
should come here. The young Briton stepped
easily past between them and the rail&mdash;behind
there was no room&mdash;and, swinging the long,
awkwardly modeled fabric to his broad
shoulder, started back just as a huge wave
heaved suddenly under the counter, heeled the
steamer far over to port, threw him off his
balance, and, his foot catching at the bottom of
her chair, hurled him, load and all, straight at
Amy&#8217;s reclining form. One instant, and even
her uplifted hands could not have saved her face;
but in that instant Armstrong had darted in,
caught the stumbling Briton on one arm, and
the full force of the shooting chair crashing
upon the other, already pierced by Filipino
lead.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></p>
<p>When, a moment later she emerged, safe and
unscratched from the confused heap of men
and furniture, it was to cut off instantly the
stutter and stammer of poor Shafto&#8217;s apologies,
to bid him go instantly for the ship&#8217;s doctor,
and, with face the color of death, to turn
quickly to Armstrong. The blow had burst
open the half-healed wound, and the blood was
streaming to the deck.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Both liner and transport turned back without
Stanley Armstrong, Doric and Sedgwick sailed
unheeded, for the highest surgical authority of
the Department of California had remanded
him to quarters at the Palace and forbidden his
return to duty with an unhealed wound. He
was sitting up again, somewhat pallid and not
too strong, but with every promise, said the
&#8220;medico,&#8221; of complete recovery within two
months. But not a month would Armstrong
wait. The Puebla was to start within the
week, and he had made up his mind. &#8220;Go,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I must.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They had been sitting about him, the night
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
this opinion was announced, in the parlor of the
suite of rooms the Primes had taken. Billy
Gray had gone with his father to the club,
Shafto had been hanging about in the agonies
of an Englishman&#8217;s first love, Gov. disappeared
a moment and came back with tickets for the
Columbia, bidding Mildred get her hat and
gloves at once, and whispering Shafto that he
had a seat for him. As the little mantel clock
struck eight Amy Lawrence, lifting up her
eyes from the book she was trying hard to believe
she meant to read, saw that Armstrong
was rising from his easy-chair, and, springing
to his side, laying her white hand on his arm,
she faltered, &#8220;Oh, please! You know the
stipulation was that you were not to stir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But then her heart began to flutter uncontrollably.
The blood went surging to her brows,
for all of a sudden, as through impulse irresistible,
her hand was seized in his&mdash;in both of
his, in fact&mdash;and the deep voice that had
pleaded at her behest for the cause of Billy
Gray was now, in impetuous flow of words that
fell upon her ears like some strain of thrilling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
music, pleading at last his own. Ever since
that day in the radiant sunshine of the Park she
had learned to look up to him as a tower of
strength, a man of mark among his fellows,
a man to be honored and obeyed. Ever
since that night at the Palace, when she saw
his glowing eyes fixed intently upon her,
and knew that he was following her every
move, she had begun to realize the depth
of his interest in her. Ever since that day
when the China slipped from her moorings,
with Witchie Garrison singling him out for
lavish farewell favors, she had wondered why
it so annoyed and stung her. Ever since the
day she read the list of killed and wounded in
the first fierce battling with the &#8220;Insurrectos&#8221;
she knew it was the sight of his name, not Billy
Gray&#8217;s, that made her for the moment faint and
dizzy, and taught her the need of greater self-control.
Ever since that moonlit night upon
the Marsden&#8217;s <i>lanai</i>, when her heart leaped at
the sudden sound of his voice, she had realized
what his coming meant to her, and ever since
that breezy day upon the broad Pacific, with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
the sailor&#8217;s song of &#8220;Land ho!&#8221; ringing from
the bows, and he, her wounded soldier, had
sprung to shield her from the crash of Shafto&#8217;s
hapless stumble, and the deck was stained with
the precious blood from that soldier&#8217;s reopened
wound, shed for her&mdash;for her who so revered
him&mdash;she had longed to hear him say the words
that alone could unlock the gates of maidenly
reserve and let her tell him&mdash;tell him with glad
and grateful heart that the love he bore her was
answered by her own. Hovering over him only
one minute, her lips half parted, her eyes still
veiled, her heart throbbing loud and fast, with
sudden movement she threw herself upon her
knees at the side of the low chair, and her burning
face, ever so lightly, was buried in the dark-blue
sleeve above that blessed wound.

<p>&#8220;<i>MEMBER OF THE FRENCH JOURNALISM</i>&#8221;</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>By</span> ALEX. KENEALY</p>
</div>

<p>Alphonse is an accredited correspondent of a Parisian
journal and gives his impression of things American as he
sees them, in a series of letters to his &#8220;small Journal for
to Read.&#8221; Their seemingly unconscious humor is so
deliciously absurd that it will convulse the reader with
laughter in nearly every line. There is no dialect in
them, and their humor lies entirely in the peculiar views
set forth, as well as the grotesque language in which they
are expressed. No book so genuinely funny has been
published in a decade, and the fun is in an entirely new
vein. Alphonse&#8217;s description of a ride in an &#8220;upstairs
berth&#8221; of a sleeping car, should be read by every regular
or occasional traveler.

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>By</span> MILES BANTOCK</p>
<p><i>With an Introduction by Findlay S. Douglas</i></p>
</div>

<p>A book for &#8220;Duffers&#8221; as well as Golfers, being a
compilation of clever things about the Ancient and Royal
Game and those who play it. Every golfer and most of
those who are not golfers should read this little book. It
contains a little that is serious and much that is pure fun,
collected from all sorts of sources, and edited by a golf
enthusiast.
</p>
<p>Just the thing to read aloud to your friends, or to
while away the monotony of a rainy afternoon or a dull
railway journey.

</div>

<p><i>EDITION DE LUXE, WITH LARGE PORTRAIT</i>
</p>
<p>A perfect reproduction of Wm. Strang&#8217;s recent etching
of Mr. Kipling, by far the best portrait yet given to
the public. The picture itself is a photogravure, size
9 × 11-1/4, enclosed in a portfolio of extra thick deckle-edge
Strathmore cover paper, size 12-1/2 × 20 inches open,
and 12-1/2 × 9-1/2 inches closed, with a beautiful cover
design in colors on the front cover, and the immortal
&#8220;Recessional&#8221; printed on the inner side of the flaps. It
is designed to be a finished production as it is especially
appropriate for mantel or bookshelf, or the picture can
be removed for framing if desired, as it is only lightly
pasted at the top. We offer this as the best portrait of
Mr. Kipling obtainable, and think in no other form is
the &#8220;Recessional&#8221; so desirable.
